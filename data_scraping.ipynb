      "\n",
      "I've finished the manwha and I have some questions about how things are in the novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read somewhere in this sub that supposedly in the novels the rulers won against the monarchs in one or more occasions, but despite having no guarantee that next time they would win again, and despite knowing that the Cup had limited \"lifespan\", they still used the Cup to revert the time again and again because they wanted to achieve an even better result with less destruction and deaths on Earth.  \n",
      "This isn't mentioned anywhere in the webtoon. There is only talk of the Earth having been destroyed several times and of the rulers using the cup after every destruction, but no mention of who had won before each use of the cup.  \n",
      "Can you clarify this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, according to the webtoon, Hunters were created simply to guarantee that at least some people would survive the clashes between rulers and monarchs.  \n",
      "But somewhere else it's said that the hunters had been created to kill the magic beasts in the gates (also created by the rulers) and so fill the Earth with mana.  \n",
      "I find it very very very hard to believe that the rulers couldn't find a simpler and less bloody way to fill the Earth with mana, and that they couldn't give powers to everybody so that more people could survive.  \n",
      "Anyway, I'd like to know how is the creation of hunters and gates explained in the novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the webtoon briefly mentions that some hunters are vessels of the rulers ad that the monarchs did the same. It's very badly explained and without Fandom I would have not understood anything at all.  \n",
      "And I still can't understand where are the vessels of the monarchs. The webtoon does not show them living on Earth. And some of the monarchs do not appear in human form at all. Only the Steel one and partially the Beast one look a bit human. And it's not clear how can they freely move between Earth and another dimension without gates.  \n",
      "How's this in the novel?  \n",
