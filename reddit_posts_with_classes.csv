['Re-Feeding GI Issues'],"['Hi everyone! I‘ve been in recovery PHP for a little over a month and am experiencing lots of GI issues from re-feeding. My dietician said it can take weeks for your body to adjust, but I was wondering if anyone would be willing to share how long it took for them? It’s definitely getting better, but it’s hard to feel like the GI issues won’t be permanent. Thank you!']",[['No comments']]
['what happens when im weight restored?'],['i genuinely have no idea how much i weigh but my doctors say im on my way to reaching my goal weight. but what happens after that from anyone elses experience? will i still have to eat as much as i am now? eat with someone? still be considered in recovery??'],"[[""I think weight is just one out of many aspects of recovery.

Our extreme hunger, or no appetite will have sorted itself out or eased down a lot more. If meals are going smoothly, and behaviours are mostly under control of course-\n\nWe sorta get gradually more independence over their own eating in an age-appropriate manner. Like meals or snacks independent from carer/family. Flexibility on times, eating with different people in different, and in settings. Incorporating fear foods. It's a phase where whoever is caring for you may reclaim control when there's any backsliding or unpreparedness."", 'Nothing happens. You continue eating according to your meal plan, you continue facing your fear foods, and you continue mentally recovering']]"

['Recovery not going well - Vent'],"[""Hi guys. I'm new to Reddit (bear with me)..  I started seeing a psychologist and a dietitian in August for my Anorexia (+ Orthorexia ??) recovery. They came up with a diet plan for weight gain (ideally +1kg a week- SCARY) and although I've been really pushing my limits I have not had any progress since. I'm struggling to gain back my appetite too. I still can't eat my fear foods (dairy, eggs, red/white meat, fats, refined carbs, and sugar etc.) but my dietitian insists I must incorporate those in my routine for weight gain. I'm also not allowed to exercise of course. I got sick last month and could not eat anything because of nausea, on top of my already poor appetite to begin with, and at my weekly weight check-up I was told I lost -0.6g than my starting weight at the clinic. Obviously I'm upset that I am letting people and my body down, but part of me still does not want to let go of my disordered beliefs/habits. ""]","[[""The thing is, everything will take time. It took me months to regain an appetite or even start seeing the physical / health benefits of my recovery. Most of my recovery was spent fatigued, everyone is different but I couldnt even imagine exercising once my body started healing all the damage that was caused. It helps to view recovery as a marathon, not a sprint. By reframing it this way, it makes choices and responses to changes easier, at least for me. For example, eating is a daily choice you have to do to survive. Although it is unpleasant or difficult today, I know in the long run, by being consistent, my body will relearn hunger cues and my appetite will come back, my body will heal, my energy will come back, etc. Food sustains life. If I choose to not eat today, even though I might not see an immediate difference in the moment, I hurt my progress in the long run and betray myself. The same goes for mental struggles. I might feel like gaining weight is scary today, but I have no idea what positive mental changes might come from recovery a year from now by putting in the effort daily to nurture my mental health, so I will keep going even if today sucks.\n\nI hope this helps, this kind of thinking really helped me get to where I am today. I also reccommend reading the anxiety/stress chapters in Atlas of the Heart by Brene Brown. From there I learned sometimes certain tasks feel impossible because of our brain's perceived notion that we would not be able to cope with it. I often remind myself that I can get through anything if all that's stopping me is my brain. Learning to cope with a certain thing also means being exposed to it constantly, which is what happens when you are recovering and gaining every day. Again, it's all a marathon with long term benefits. I hope any of this helps!""]]"
['Is it common to experience extreme hunger several months into recovery?'],"['Anorexia kinda snuck up on me. It didn\'t start in the typical ""i need to lose weight so i\'m gonna restrict"" way, it was a combination of the psychiatric meds i was on at the time that made me lose appetite + depression telling me i didn\'t deserve to eat which made me lose a significant amount of weight. But then i noticed people started treating me better + started being more attracted to me which made me develop an obsession with being thin, being afraid of certain foods, eating below normal amounts etc. I was never actually fat but i was a bit bullied when i was in school for being chubby. I only realized i had a problem when the thoughts about my body and food were consuming me which made me reach out to a friend who dealt with a more severe version of anorexia and that was going through recovery and she gave me a reality check which made me want to get better. I started taking mood stabilizers which i guess helped but it was mostly me & myself. The thing is, when i started recovery everything tasted tremendously good and i wanted to eat all the time and i read that extreme hunger is normal in recovery. But now it has been several months and although not all food tastes as good as it did in the beggining i still find myself thinking about food and eating all the time. I don\'t experience binges but i feel like it\'s too much? And that i should be over it by now. In the beggining i was fine bc i was still very thin but since it has been months i\'ve gained some weight and i\'m scared i\'m just gonna keep gaining and gaining. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it normal to experience extreme hunger even many months into recovery?']","[['This is actually very normal. I experience extreme hunger after being fully weight restored, having my period back, and being several several months into recovery. I know it’s cliché, but the only thing that stopped it was leaning into it.', 'Yep, I still get it more than a year later.']]"
['Addiction of food?'],"[""Can you be addicted to food because of recovery? I'm in a recovery but I have various conflicting thoughts. I've been wondering about addiction to food since yesterday. do I need this food?  Is it an addiction?""]","[[""No. You don't get addicted to food because you are recovering from an ed. Unless you actively replace one disorder for another. And yes, you do need food.""]]"
['I’m not anorexic but I restrict?'],"['I have no desire to lose weight, but I get so depressed I lose my appetite and then it gets to danger zone where I’m severely underweight and then when I’m weight restored people think I’m ‘recovered’ until the next major depressive episode. \n\nThis past one caused by food insecurity and having no supports']","[[""I struggle with this as well. It has been very difficult seeking help for this issue because all of the ED supports in my area are very geared to the more typical anorexia issues like fear of weight gain, etc. I absolutely *hate* my underweight body and have developed unreal anxiety and a complete breakdown of my self esteem from dealing with my eating issues. But when I'm depressed, I just cannot bring myself to eat. I wish I had advice or something to share, but all I can say is that I relate and you are not alone."", ""this is called anorexia: which is greek for loss of appitite. People often refer to anorexia nervosa, the eating disorder, as anorexia. However, in literature, they're not the same.\n\nYou sound like you have anorexia, so a loss of appitite because of your depression. This isn't necessarily an eating disorder, but a disordered eating pattern: a secondary symptom to your primary problem, which is depression. \n\nHowever, I don't know you or your struggles, so I can't definitely tell you it isn't an eating disorder. Regardless, I would seek help, because the effects of anorexia are the same as anorexia nervosa. Your body doesn't care why its lost weight, its still suffering just as much!""]]"
['Had anorexia without even knowing it *m teen'],"[""I started losing weight pretty slowly. Mainly after switching schools and walking to and from every day for about an hour with basically just a sandwich and milk to keep me going. I would eat meat and vegetable dinner until i was full at night. It evened out after I dropped out but I think i was still at a deficit for a while but I didn't even see it as a problem until my friend started calling me a drug addict and anorexic and travis bickle hahaha, to my face. I kind of appreciate male friends for their bluntness there cause when i was in school nobody said anything except calling me a school shooter and a girl offering me food sometimes. I should've seen the signs as a 187cm male eating so little. Is this common with males not even realising what they're doing? BTW im 17 now and started losing weight around 16 and a half and I probably didnt have good eating habits until 2 months ago but progress has been fast and my libido is better and my body dont look bony at all anymore. Would I have stunted my growth even though part of the reason (i think) i got skinnier aside from low calories on school days was because i got taller? I know I  still have time to grow but its worrying me cause i am not taller than my dad yet but I dont know if it would stunt my growth cause I was about 15% body fat. I was never muscular its hard to tell but i was yknow skinny fat with moobs and a gut.""]","[[""so you ate too little as a child, but did you like... have anxiety over calories? fear food? i'm happy you're in a better place but accidentally losing weight because you don't care about food would not be anorexia.""]]"
