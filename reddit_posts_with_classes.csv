That's literally what it's for. It might be a matter of being hospitalized until you're medically stable and then moving to a different level of care because I know that even some inpatient places don't have the ability to medically monitor and respond the way that is preferable when you're really underweight. \n\nEither way, I chose to recover on my own anyway and although it's been really difficult I did a lot of work to ensure it was done safely and now I'm not underweight anymore (but still am in recovery). If you want me to message you, please let me know."", ""Yes, you can hold on trust me. Perhaps you can seek another hospital? This doesn't make any sense to not treat patient because person is too underweight, what a circus. This is for lawsuit really.

['Nausea after every single meal???'],"[""It's almost been a full week of not tracking calories properly and I'm still trying to adjust to it. I already feel like I'm eating more frequently than before which is stressing me out especially since I'm weight restored now but what's making it worse is that the past couple of days I've been hit with mild nausea and stomach discomfort after I eat anything. I'll eat breakfast and then fifteen minutes later start feeling queasy. It gets worse with every meal too, I had dinner half an hour ago and already want to go puke. I've also been experiencing a bit of lightheadedness and lots and lots of sweating at random moments which I brushed off before because I've been sick with a cold for the past week and thought the lightheaded feeling was being caused by the intense sinus pain but I worry it's something more. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Has anyone experienced something similiar to this in their recovery? I feel like this is some signal confirming that I'm eating too much and need to get a grip on myself but I don't know if that's rationality or the disorder talking. I'm so confused.

['I’m worried about my self-image and how it might affect my eating habits… help'],"['So I’ve been in recovery for several years now, but occasionally struggle with my past bulimic tendencies. Lately I’ve been stressed with college and I find I’m binge eating a lot of unhealthy food at night. I’m trying to break the habit. Anyway, I’m a performer and I have a show coming up where my arms will show and I’m dancing a decent bit. I’ve always been self-conscious about my arms and I know I wouldn’t be able to lose weight and tone them by the time the show comes around. I’m dreading the thought of seeing pictures of myself later and hating them. I want this to be a good experience but I’m genuinely very scared that I’ll despise the way I look and it’ll ruin all of the good parts for me. Cried hard about it yesterday and scheduled a session with my therapist for today, which I ended up missing. I haven’t gone to classes in two days and I didn’t eat at all today if you don’t count the binging in the middle of the night. I’m really worried I’m slipping and I want to be confident in myself, develop healthier eating habits, and prevent myself from becoming afraid of food again. Is anyone who has recovered able to help with this? My mental health is taking a blow right now.']",[['No comments']]
['Cant stop thinking about food after big meals'],['If I just eat small meals I feel like I’m never hungry. Once I eat a big meal all I can think about is food …. Is anyone else like this? Is this kind of similar to extreme hunger?'],"[['From my understanding, that makes sense. Your body isn’t used to larger (I’m guessing much closer to normal than you think) amounts of food any more, so when you take in this amount, your blood glucose spikes, and then crashes shortly after. This will slow after you’re eating more regularly. Or your body is just so excited that you’re ingesting food that it wants you to continue. Regardless, if you can, speak to a nutritionist to see if it’s okay to eat smaller meals or if they recommend these larger meals. That can be very patient specific']]"

['Recovery Symptoms or something else - How to stop Overthinking? :('],"[""How do you cope with overthinking your recovery sypmptoms, mostly GI related?   \nI can't stop thinking what if I developed this and that GI issue, I google the symptoms etc. And I heard that in the recovery there are many symptoms that mimic some diseases and issues but they go away later in the recovery.   \nMy biggest problems are constant gas and trapped gas which I had during my period of restriction as well (is it due to my metabolism getting slower because of undereating?) but even more so now in recovery + cramps and nausea from that gas. I don't have pain and BMs are pretty ok. I did some tests - blood work, ultrasound, poop tests, thyroid hormones etc and they are ok. But I'm still underweight and I don't have a period for a year now. I don't want to do some invasive tests (and doctors didn't suggest them) and I'm pretty scared of doing them as well. But I'm constantly thinkig what if it is SIBO or IBS or this or that. Should I wait to weight restore and give it some time and see how I feel later? :( ""]","[['Did you check full spectrum of thyroid, not only TSH? Other hormones as well?

['struggling a year and a half into recovery'],"['So, I (22F) been in completely self-guided recovery for almost a year and a half now after restricting for about 10 years. I’ve come really far with my mindset, I’ve been able to stop associating my weight gain with negative things and just sort of detach from it, and I’ve really started to actually enjoy eating. But lately it’s been getting more difficult again and I’m just seeking some advice/encouragement.\n\nFor one thing, I keep going up clothing sizes and having to buy new jeans, bras, etc. because my old ones just physically don’t fit me at all. And I’m in college and that shit’s expensive. And for another thing, Im surrounded by people who are still so deeply entrenched in diet culture, and they don’t all know about my ED—most of them don’t, in fact. \n\nFor example, my long-term boyfriend’s sister and her partner are both really focused on dieting, working out and weight loss, to the point that it’s almost all they talk about. Not only is it triggering, it’s also just incredibly irritating to me because I can’t get this thought out of my head that they might be judging me for how my body has changed or labeling me as “unhealthy” when they, in fact, have no idea what I’ve been through and how hard I’ve worked to save myself. And the thought of that makes me really uncomfortable and also makes me angry, which probably isn’t healthy because it’s just a thought I’m projecting onto them and I don’t know if they think that way at all.\n\nAnd the last thing is that I’ve been having more and more physical symptoms related to recovery since I’ve been going increasingly “all in” over the last few months. I’ve been really tired, my blood sugar and temperature are both all over the place, and my digestion is just completely off. And yeah, it’s just gotten to be a lot to deal with.\n\nSo I don’t really know what the point of this post is, but can anyone relate at all? Any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.']","[[""I chose to do self recovery too (as in was pressured to do inpatient/hospitalization but decided not to) and trust me I know how fucking hard it is and can relate to what you're talking about. I'm working with my doctor, therapist, and a dietician, though. \n\nI attempted to go all in as well but it was really hard on my liver and my blood glucose and heart rate also started doing weird things so I've had to sort of find a balance between all in and more structure (for instance I just cannot feasibly respond to my mental hunger everytime without it causing scary spikes in my heart rate and liver enzyme levels)\n\nIf you want me to message you to talk a little more in-depth please let me know! It might be really helpful to talk to someone going through a similar process.""]]"
"['Just wanted to gain weight and had some motivation to do so, I fcked up.']","['I stopped counting calories a few days ago and It has been hard to follow my hunger cues and learn how to make meals for myself since then, I feel like a child.\n\nToday I decided to follow my intuition and stop when Im full/satiated after the meal. So I made myself a meal with healthy stuff and decided that If I wanted more I could add more.\n\nAfter I finished my meal, I didn’t feel satiated at all, I was craving more. There was cheesecake in the fridge, but I was so scared of eating something so sugary and fattening that I decided to make something caloric but “healthier”. So I prepared a bowl with weetabix, wallnuts, almonds, and banana, something that would fill me up but also make me gain some weight.\n\nAfter I finished that, I finally felt full, but I was still thinking about that dam cheesecake. So I thought “fck it” and ate it all, even after feeling uncomfortably full. \n\nI didn’t know what came over me, I was driven to the bathroom, I kneeled over and prged everything I could until I saw pieces of some of my first attempt at lunch and decided that was enough. \n\nMy throat hurts and I feel so defeated, that was like a natural instinct to rush to prge. I don’t normally prge but I feel like I pushed myself too much today. There is a little part of me that feels relieved that I didn’t digest that cheesecake, and also that bowl of calories (the nuts and banana one). \n\nAnyways, at least I learned that I cant push myself to eat everything that I crave because that would result in a prge. I hope that I never prge again because that was so disgusting.']","[['Sending you all the hugs.  You didn’t eat too many calories —and please remember for next time that when you have something like cheesecake you won’t suddenly gain weight. Our bodies don’t do that.  Our skin and hair also need rich foods like cheesecake in order to look their best and not dry out.  \nYou ate intuitively and allowed yourself something delicious— and you can tell yourself next time that you deserve to be nourished and to have delicious food.  You can also tell yourself that you are ok and will just scale it back the next day.  This way you will learn not to binge and purge.  Just keep working on your inner voice and keep being kind to yourself. \nIf you feel very full after something like cheesecake just sit with the feeling and gauge it. Let your body’s cues become familiar so that you can learn to eat anything you want without getting too full in the future. \nIt takes time and forgiveness and a kind of thoughtfulness that refuses hateful self-talk.', 'I say with this kindness and experience. Perhaps an alternative to this lesson:\n“I can’t push myself to eat everything I crave because it’ll result in a purge”\n\nCould actually be this:\n“Mentally restricting and trying to cover a craving with a healthier option is likely to result in consuming far more than feels comfortable and I’ll feel tempted to purge. Instead I can push myself to have a satisfying amount of what I truly fancy, trust my body handle it and move on with my life”']]"
['Opinions?'],"['I don’t know if this may be triggering to anyone so TW just incase.\n\nI’ve never really asked questions on here before, but I am lost right now and would like advice if that’s possible. I am 18 years old and have been dealing with Anorexia for almost 3 years now. A few months ago I had reached my goal weight (won’t disclose that) and thought everything was going well. I don’t have the “classic signs” of anorexia anymore like caring about body image or purposely trying to lose weight or eat less, or any other symptoms I had before in my recovery. My one issue is that even though I don’t care about any of that, I still can’t eat enough. I don’t do it on purpose. I have lost a significant amount of weight over the last few months, but I am not doing it on purpose. I am trying to eat things with higher calories on purpose, trying to focus on eating when I should but I haven’t been able to gain the weight. The next issue, I haven’t told anyone. My doctors and family all think i’m doing great, which I am all except the weight loss. I don’t know why I can’t eat right, I really don’t do it on purpose I just don’t get hunger or don’t remember to eat everything I need to. I don’t want to go to impatient again, I want to fix it on my own. I wish I could ask for help, but I don’t know if they will send me to impatient against my will (can they do that?). I am going to college in the spring and they’ve threatened me before with not letting me go, can they actual do that too? I want to get better. I don’t feel like I have anorexia anymore, but I can’t gain or maintain my weight. How do I fix this and should I ask for help? Will they send me to impatient again? Please give advice.']","[['update: told my mom, on my way to hospital']]"
['What do I do?'],"[""So I've been debating something for a while. I'm not sure if I wanted to post anywhere in reddit. But then I saw someone else posted about something so I was like I'll ask.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what to do. My extended family and family of origin are throwing an early birthday party for my Grandmother this year for her 90th. But as I've learned details and though over some things I'm not so sure. The first one was, we'll it's on my birthday. I was soo psyched that my birthday is on a Saturday this year so that my husband would have the day off and it'd be a good birthday. My birthday has always been a big deal to me. \nThis is 3 to 5 or so hours away driving. We haven't drove that much since 2017 but my kids were very young then, one wasn't even here yet.\nSo like also I have an eating disorder and I'm soo worried that I'll relapse again. I already did in July. And I'm just starting to get back on track and eat 3 meals a day. I'm anorexic. \nPlus all the people I know and don't know. And I dk how my autistic children will handle all the noise and the new people, people they barely have been around in their lives.\nPlus like soon it's gonna be winter and it can bad.\nI love my Grandma and I wish I could just visit her, like just my family, not tons of people.\nAm I a jerk? Don't fully answer that because I don't take rejection well.\nI just wish I had known before a few weeks ago abd this is next month.\nEveryone else lives within 5 to 20 miles of this place. I live across the state! Not really my fault because this is where i grew up.\nBasically what would you do in my situation? Oh and explaining a no to my family of origin is like......no.
