Opinions?,"I don’t know if this may be triggering to anyone so TW just incase.

I’ve never really asked questions on here before, but I am lost right now and would like advice if that’s possible. I am 18 years old and have been dealing with Anorexia for almost 3 years now. A few months ago I had reached my goal weight (won’t disclose that) and thought everything was going well. I don’t have the “classic signs” of anorexia anymore like caring about body image or purposely trying to lose weight or eat less, or any other symptoms I had before in my recovery. My one issue is that even though I don’t care about any of that, I still can’t eat enough. I don’t do it on purpose. I have lost a significant amount of weight over the last few months, but I am not doing it on purpose. I am trying to eat things with higher calories on purpose, trying to focus on eating when I should but I haven’t been able to gain the weight. The next issue, I haven’t told anyone. My doctors and family all think i’m doing great, which I am all except the weight loss. I don’t know why I can’t eat right, I really don’t do it on purpose I just don’t get hunger or don’t remember to eat everything I need to. I don’t want to go to impatient again, I want to fix it on my own. I wish I could ask for help, but I don’t know if they will send me to impatient against my will (can they do that?). I am going to college in the spring and they’ve threatened me before with not letting me go, can they actual do that too? I want to get better. I don’t feel like I have anorexia anymore, but I can’t gain or maintain my weight. How do I fix this and should I ask for help? Will they send me to impatient again? Please give advice."
Recovery Symptoms or something else - How to stop Overthinking? :(,"How do you cope with overthinking your recovery sypmptoms, mostly GI related?   
I can't stop thinking what if I developed this and that GI issue, I google the symptoms etc. And I heard that in the recovery there are many symptoms that mimic some diseases and issues but they go away later in the recovery.   
My biggest problems are constant gas and trapped gas which I had during my period of restriction as well (is it due to my metabolism getting slower because of undereating?) but even more so now in recovery + cramps and nausea from that gas. I don't have pain and BMs are pretty ok. I did some tests - blood work, ultrasound, poop tests, thyroid hormones etc and they are ok. But I'm still underweight and I don't have a period for a year now. I don't want to do some invasive tests (and doctors didn't suggest them) and I'm pretty scared of doing them as well. But I'm constantly thinkig what if it is SIBO or IBS or this or that. Should I wait to weight restore and give it some time and see how I feel later? :( "
struggling a year and a half into recovery,"So, I (22F) been in completely self-guided recovery for almost a year and a half now after restricting for about 10 years. I’ve come really far with my mindset, I’ve been able to stop associating my weight gain with negative things and just sort of detach from it, and I’ve really started to actually enjoy eating. But lately it’s been getting more difficult again and I’m just seeking some advice/encouragement.

For one thing, I keep going up clothing sizes and having to buy new jeans, bras, etc. because my old ones just physically don’t fit me at all. And I’m in college and that shit’s expensive. And for another thing, Im surrounded by people who are still so deeply entrenched in diet culture, and they don’t all know about my ED—most of them don’t, in fact. 

For example, my long-term boyfriend’s sister and her partner are both really focused on dieting, working out and weight loss, to the point that it’s almost all they talk about. Not only is it triggering, it’s also just incredibly irritating to me because I can’t get this thought out of my head that they might be judging me for how my body has changed or labeling me as “unhealthy” when they, in fact, have no idea what I’ve been through and how hard I’ve worked to save myself. And the thought of that makes me really uncomfortable and also makes me angry, which probably isn’t healthy because it’s just a thought I’m projecting onto them and I don’t know if they think that way at all.

And the last thing is that I’ve been having more and more physical symptoms related to recovery since I’ve been going increasingly “all in” over the last few months. I’ve been really tired, my blood sugar and temperature are both all over the place, and my digestion is just completely off. And yeah, it’s just gotten to be a lot to deal with.

So I don’t really know what the point of this post is, but can anyone relate at all? Any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated."
"Just wanted to gain weight and had some motivation to do so, I fcked up.","I stopped counting calories a few days ago and It has been hard to follow my hunger cues and learn how to make meals for myself since then, I feel like a child.

Today I decided to follow my intuition and stop when Im full/satiated after the meal. So I made myself a meal with healthy stuff and decided that If I wanted more I could add more.

After I finished my meal, I didn’t feel satiated at all, I was craving more. There was cheesecake in the fridge, but I was so scared of eating something so sugary and fattening that I decided to make something caloric but “healthier”. So I prepared a bowl with weetabix, wallnuts, almonds, and banana, something that would fill me up but also make me gain some weight.

After I finished that, I finally felt full, but I was still thinking about that dam cheesecake. So I thought “fck it” and ate it all, even after feeling uncomfortably full. 

I didn’t know what came over me, I was driven to the bathroom, I kneeled over and prged everything I could until I saw pieces of some of my first attempt at lunch and decided that was enough. 

My throat hurts and I feel so defeated, that was like a natural instinct to rush to prge. I don’t normally prge but I feel like I pushed myself too much today. There is a little part of me that feels relieved that I didn’t digest that cheesecake, and also that bowl of calories (the nuts and banana one). 

Anyways, at least I learned that I cant push myself to eat everything that I crave because that would result in a prge. I hope that I never prge again because that was so disgusting."
triggered,i overheard a conversation of one of my close family members talking to another distant family member about how a few months ago before my ed i gained 'good' weight and that my legs and face filled out. i just told them off and told them to quit telling people my business. i am currently crying right now. i dont want to think about it i am finally starting to eat right and all i can think about is looking like that again i am scared
Nauseous when hungry,"Hi everyone. I’ve been in recovery for a few years which some lapses scattered throughout and I’m curious if I’m falling back into it again and if anyone has any tips. For the past few days I’ve been struggling to eat because of some pretty significant stomach upset (I have severe IBS) due to some stressors. My hunger cues have been inconsistent for years now, so I eat on a (loose) schedule, but the past few days, I’ve been genuinely nauseated by the thought of food, but not in the “this is going to make me fat” way, more in the “everything sounds like it’s gonna taste bad” way. I will randomly get super hungry and I have about 15 seconds to eat something before it turns into intense nausea, where there’s no way I could eat anything. 
Does anyone have any suggestions? I recently uprooted my life and moved to the opposite side of the world and still haven’t found a therapist. Thank you all ❤️"
What do I do?,"So I've been debating something for a while. I'm not sure if I wanted to post anywhere in reddit. But then I saw someone else posted about something so I was like I'll ask.

I'm trying to figure out what to do. My extended family and family of origin are throwing an early birthday party for my Grandmother this year for her 90th. But as I've learned details and though over some things I'm not so sure. The first one was, we'll it's on my birthday. I was soo psyched that my birthday is on a Saturday this year so that my husband would have the day off and it'd be a good birthday. My birthday has always been a big deal to me. 
This is 3 to 5 or so hours away driving. We haven't drove that much since 2017 but my kids were very young then, one wasn't even here yet.
So like also I have an eating disorder and I'm soo worried that I'll relapse again. I already did in July. And I'm just starting to get back on track and eat 3 meals a day. I'm anorexic. 
Plus all the people I know and don't know. And I dk how my autistic children will handle all the noise and the new people, people they barely have been around in their lives.
Plus like soon it's gonna be winter and it can bad.
I love my Grandma and I wish I could just visit her, like just my family, not tons of people.
Am I a jerk? Don't fully answer that because I don't take rejection well.
I just wish I had known before a few weeks ago abd this is next month.
Everyone else lives within 5 to 20 miles of this place. I live across the state! Not really my fault because this is where i grew up.
Basically what would you do in my situation? Oh and explaining a no to my family of origin is like......no. Shame and guilt comes with that."
Weak legs and stamina,"Hi everyone! So first my question - I've been struggling with anorexia for about 5-6 years. It's a pretty long story. I'm 17 (male). Im in good recovery right now-From 182cm 46kg to 182cm 59kg in 8 months when I started my recovery. Before that I was almost hospitalized and was in big danger for my life. Right now I go to the gym, eat well, try to build muscle, and feel amazing about that but when I do my favorite sports like gymnastics and parkour my legs feel weak like they don't have strength like most people and my stamina is low compared to my friends. Is that normal after so many years of starvation and will I feel better? I'm scared of that and I just wanna hear if someone has the same problem with the legs. (Below is my full story in short if someone is interested)  
It all started when I was 11 because I started being obsessed with being thin. At that time I loved doing sports like martial arts, climbing, running and especially parkour. I thought it was better to be skinny because I thought I was going to be more ''athletic'' because I was lighter. Around the age of 12 things got pretty worse. I was 172cm 39kg. My mother was hell scared for me, we went to many psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors (and even some folk healers...). I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and OCD. I sticked with one psychologist who helped me a lot and things got better. I started eating enough to have some sort of energy but not gaining weight. I was taking antidepressants (Zoloft) until I was 15 but I stopped them because I was feeling better. But when I was 16 things went bad again. I started eating less and less food every day and my rituals from the OCD started going crazy like my whole day was a ritual. At this time I was 182cm at 46kg bw. I was feeling a strong exhaustion all the time. My legs were so heavy and it was a horror to move classrooms in school because it was extremely hard taking the stairs. In the morning I had a pretty exhausting ritual cardio workout. At one moment I stopped going to school because I couldn't walk and pretty much just laid in bed at home. Almost got hospitalized but my parents took me to another psychologist and psychiatrist. I started taking antidepressants again(Biflox). My dad met me with his friend's sons who are athletes. They signed me into a fitness club. At first, it was really hard for me because I didn't have much energy. But with time I started enjoying it. I got passionate about bodybuilding and fitness and just wanted to fix my terrible life and most importantly make my mother proud and happy. I started going regularly and started bulking. For about 8-9 months from the beginning of this incredible journey, I gained about 13kg, and right now I'm 182cm at 59kg bw. There's a looot more details about that story but it I think that's just too long for now. So yeah here's my question- Right now except for the gym I'm into sports again- skateboarding, bmx, gymnastics and parkour. But I'm feeling my legs pretty weak in comparison with my friend. Like my legs just don't have the power and stamina they had when I was younger. Like, I'm 17 and I don't think I should feel like that. It has been 8 months of recovery. Is it normal to still feel like most people are stronger and more explosive than me?"
"I have a question (I prefer you be fully recovered or at least a long way into active recovery to answer this question, I don’t want to unintentionally trigger anyone early in recovery. If you’re early in recovery, kindly scroll passed this post)","This is I guess specifically for the people who were dangerously/extremely underweight. Once you entered recovery, how soon did you notice your appearance changing for the better? How long did it take to see that you were putting on weight? 

I ask because I have a friend that claims she’s in active recovery, but it has been four months and she still looks just as thin. I am very concerned for her health and I feel she might be lying to people about recovering when she isn’t. If anyone can illuminate for me, I’d appreciate it. Is it possible her treatment team just has her taking it very, very, very slow? I just can’t imagine how in treatment someone would appear to be making no progress four months in ☹️"
Exercise in recovery - I’m finally stopping,"That’s basically the whole story. Been recovering for 2 years but hedging my bets with exercise. Walking 8,000+ steps a day was the thing for awhile. Then there was the month I did 15,000 steps. Then when I crashed, I rested for a month. But then back to 8000+ again. Don’t get me started on the several attempts to start weight lifting.

I have rationalized it a million times and a million ways. I have told myself that recovered people who say not to exercise are lying. They MUSTVE been exercising and they are just lying to themselves. How else does the overshoot go away, I thought.

My plan 2 years ago was this - I will know I’m healed when the weight stabilizes on its own. Then and only then I can start doing the things that feel good.

So for now, short, slow walks, and stretching only.

Every time I over exercise or under eat I end up crashing into insomnia, anxiety, “adrenal fatigue”, and I’m absolutely useless to my kids.

Im done. And as a man, to any men out there, NO - BUILDING MUSCLE IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOUR RECOVERY.

Anyone with experience in this game I just played, I’d love to hear how you finally figured out that rest was of paramount importance.

Today I’m going to lay down a LOT. Haha"
Face Changes After Recovering,I have had a lot of issues lately with being really self conscious of my face. I have a very thin face and it's very asymmetrical. Has anyone else experienced that this helped once they started recovering?
Low mood and self esteem during recovery,I haven't been proper restricting in months but I only eat dinner and I decided I wanted to eat normally and eat healthy foods that are good for my body. Today's the first day doing that and I feel depressed and like I doubled in size despite knowing that's impossible within a few hours. Has anyone else felt this way and how can I deal with it? :(
"Do I actually have extreme hunger even after only half a year of restricting/maintaining a LW, or is my ""recovery"" just binging?",
Weird hunger / nausea combo,"has anyone else experienced the strange repetition of eating a lot or even just average & feeling sickeningly nausea after to the point you think you'll throw up. Then after an hour or so you have a ravenous appetite? 

I ate a bit today, but it was all smooshed in. As I keep grabbing things for myself in fear my guardian will forget times (happens a lot) so I am eating a lot in the weight restoration process.

8.30 breakfast:3x weetabix with hot water (snacked on a lot of biscoff)
10.30 snack: rocky road
12: toastie and 2x pikelets 
1.30-2pm:protein bar & apple  (fruit salad came later, as my guardian remembered which surprised me)

I felt sick after the fruit. am I eating too much?  is the nausea from overeating or just stomach stuff"
Weights going up and down/looking different everyday,"Hi,
TW I describe my body a little bit.
So my weight is going up and down a lot, in the last few weeks. I don’t weigh myself, but I notice that I look very different every day and week. For example, yesterday I was kind of balloon-y everywhere, my thighs touched and I had a very round face, but today in the morning my thighs didn’t touch and my face is a little less puffy/round. It has been happening a lot lately and it makes it really hard to consistently eat because of how much my appearance changes. And it seems that whenever my face is less puffy, my legs are more puffy and when my ankles are less puffy my upper body is more puffy. I think that’s water retention but I’m 4 months in recovery and pre-ed weight + some more so I don’t know why it’s lasting so long. Also I noticed when I consistently take baths I don’t look as puffy. And my stomach started bloating like crazy in the last few weeks too… like pregnant-bloating-type crazy :(.

I’m kind of spiraling because someone close to me pointed out my thighs and that if I keep eating the way I do I’ll become twice as big. Even though I’ve kept a (kind of ) stable weight for the last 2 months lol."
laying down after meals,i get tired really easy when i eat alot which i know is normal and called a food coma. is it okay to lay down and sleep as soon as you get done eating or should i wait an hour or so?
I feel like I'm doing this alone,"up until now I've been making my meal plan alone, mostly by choice, since it's very scary for me to eat food made by someone else.
but two day ago my dietician at the ED treatment center I'm going to talked me into letting my parents prepare  previously weighed food (only at lunch, at dinner I make it myself) from Monday through Friday, Saturday I prepare my own food and Sunday I eat their food with them.

this is already pretty hard for me, and the first thing my mom said when I told her the plan was complain shesmd have to prepare a while other meal Monday through Friday, which made me feel awful cause I already feel like a burden.

anyways, today is Sunday, and they completely forgot. my dietician gave them the plan literally not even 48h ago. 

they only remembered at lunch time, after they had already bought the food just for them and my brother, and when I told them I didn't want to eat the food because they only bought it for themselves they started yelling abc saying : ""what's the problem? we can just give you a few pieces of pasta from our plates"" 

like a goddamn dog.

then they proceeded to yell at me about how clearly I'm trying to punish them or making excuses cause I don't want to eat the food.

I'm so fucking angry. it's the only thing they have to do. the only thing they have to remember, is it too much to ask? even a few months ago, when I was struggling with purging after meals I had to be the one to remind them to close the bathroom doors most of the time. literally one thing they have to remember and they just don't .

at this point it feels like I'm doing this completely alone without any support. they're happy on the days when I'm fine, but on the harder days their first reaction is to yell at me, or if they do try to approach the situation in a gentler way, it doesn't last long cause they get mad at me the second I can't perfectly explain everything to them.
I'm starting to think they just don't care."
ED Recovery HELPPPP,"I am currently finding the best approach to recovery. I tried all in a new months ago and got triggered by fat gain rapidly and started restriciting again, doing 10k steps, and going to the gym.

&#x200B;

I am so lost -- i have an exercise compulsion.. but i want to gain weight at a incremental way without putting on to much fat (and build muscle) 

&#x200B;

Howver I now that wont remove my gym/food earing association. I don't know what to do?

&#x200B;

A rd i spoke to says she will implement the plate by plate approach at give me 3meals/2,3 snacks per day and tell me to reduce exercise.

&#x200B;

A sports coach I spoke with says she will ALSO tell me to reduce steps and days at the gym but will give me a calorie incremental increase goal and a gym routine to follow. I feel like this may allow me to see i CAN TAKE rest from the gym and eat the same amount.

&#x200B;

I just dont know what approach to take because i fear once i start eating more, I will develop extremem hunger again. I dont want to get overwhelmed by tracking everything like every olive lol.. but i also want to learn how much protein/carbs/fats my body CAN actually take in! I feel the dietician will tell me to stop moving but i honeslty wont be able to UNLESS I HAVE A ROUTINE TO FOLLOW.

What do i do??? Please help :)"
Does the weight still redistribute if you keep exercising?,
I am starting to realize I have a problem and I need help.,"Hello everyone, I think I’m in the process of developing an eating disorder, or at least disordered eating, and it’s really scaring me. Throughout high school, I hated my thighs. I was small, but I thought my thighs were huge. I always tried stupid little “thigh gap” workouts that never worked. However, as I got a little older and the hourglass body type became more popular, I became more confident. I told myself I could have “fat thighs” as long as I had a flat stomach and small waist. My sophomore year of college I gained weight and it went straight to my stomach. I hated myself and tried to eat healthier and go to the gym but it wasn’t working. I hit my max heaviness December 2022. I graduated in May and that’s when the I started restricting myself. It wasn’t necessarily a decision I made, I just stopped eating so much. Now I am having severe difficulty eating at all. I’m almost back to my high school weight and while it makes me happy to look at myself, I want to enjoy food again. It is genuinely starting to scare me. I can’t eat even when I want to. I have absolutely no appetite. I hate trying to defend myself to others when they question why I didn’t eat much of my meal, but I also can’t eat it. I’m not even thinking about the calories or anything like that, I just can’t eat. I have no desire for food I used to crave. I hate it. How do I reverse what I’ve done?"
Weight gain comments and face fat,"I asked someone specifically not to comment on my body but they got drunk and happy and said “I know you won’t probably think this as a good thing but you honestly look like you’ve put in weight” and now I cannot cope. I left the club alone pretending I was tired and I’m sobbing in my room. I know I’ve gained weight but it wasn’t out of choice and they only think I could hold onto was the idea that other people wouldn’t notice or wouldn’t care. But it’s all ruined. I just want to lose it all again but my health is ruined from 8 years of anorexia meaning it’s so much harder. 

Also my fave is so puffy. I have been higher weights in the past and never had this much facial fat. It is my biggest trigger for relapse. I refuse all photos. What is wrong with me? I have always had a defined jawline and pointy chin (heart shaped face) but since I’ve gained weight following a really severe relapse it genuinely looks like I’m a different person. I do not recognise myself. My cheeks are wide and my chin is saggy, my eyes are puffy and I don’t have any jawline. It’s like my submandibular glands are constantly swollen. Does anyone have any advice or reason for this? Can someone give me tips? I’ve tried gua sha and oil and sleeping propped up and I just cry every day almost at the sight of my own face. It’s not the face I’ve had my whole life."
Anyone required pharmaceuticals to recover?,"Eg. SSRIs, hydrocortisone or stuff like mirtazapine?

I remember reading sometimes doctors will give steroids for awhile to people who are pretty severe. Or drugs to increase appetite or improve digestion."
I feel out of control,"TW: mentions of SH

I'm not allowed to exercise, or go on walks. I'm not allowed in the kitchen, interact with food beyond eating. Now I can't even decide when to take my olanzapine because my nan argues she has that control so I take it even when I don't feel worked up over meals. 

I feel out of control with everything, I feel like my life in this little over a month of recovery via outpatient I'm just slugging my way through meals, snacks, nausea and gaining weight to a point my body is something that looks foreign to me. I wasn't even dangerously underweight, nor had any real health problems from it all that needed hospital. Atp with the weight I've gained I'm probably close to being restored.

I don't know how to cope with it, I'm 17 turning 18 in december but I feel like a kid again with nothing being my decision or want. I'm miserable and just keep feeling stripped down of everything. I can't even bleach & dye my own roots because of the fact I don't even know if my hair could handle it with how it was already thinning from my ED.

I don't want to go out of the house even when im 'allowed' to because then I have to shower and get dressed with this,, body which is making me feel nauseous to even exist in. I don't want people to even look at me, I can't stand my family even glancing at me as I feel as though everything is scrutinising my weight gain. I can't stop crying I feel like some sort of kicked dog that's being force-fed.

Even THEN I'm still a hypocrite because I actively want food. my appetite is insane.

It's all overwhelming and I'm wanting to go back to harming myself how I did before my ED formed, too return some control of my body. Which is awful and I don't know how to even communicate or combat this."
Extreme hunger tips for y'all!,"Try to eat consistently throughout the day. Even if being busy makes it easier to ignore your hunger, eat big breakfasts and get snacks. There's nothing wrong with eating lots of snacks at night but I've found that eating very frequently reduces my edema a lot. It also helps you to regain (mental) hunger cues, which helped me let go of the idea that I was bingeing.

For the same reason, don't exaggerate on the caffeine. I know I know, you might be able to handle it much better now that you're eating enough, but it increases anxiety, worsens edema and it's often an attempt to still the hunger.

Eat big meals if you feel like it. If you're not craving anything hearty just yet, that's okay too! Just don't fall into the trap of eating tiny portions at meals because it feels possible to restrict/eat 'normal' portions with others around. You don't have to eat a little sandwich with a handful of crisps and an apple, followed by a sleeve of crackers, 2 chocolate bars and half a box of cereal if you were actually craving three of those sandwiches or a large pizza.

Don't skimp on the fats. No, they're not empty calories. Your body might actually be asking specifically for fats. Volume eating will make your extreme hunger so much worse and your digestion will be terrible, especially in early recovery.

Cook and buy in bulk!! Those individual packets may feel safe, but they're not serving you well right now. This reduces costs too.

If you open social media to look at food content or start to scroll through recipes to meal plan, get a snack. This is hunger (unless you're trying to find extreme hunger videos to justify your intake right after eating a bunch) I PROMISE. Even if you think you can go without food for a bit longer. Your mental and physical hunger are disconnected right now. I watched so much food content until deep into recovery and now it's bizarre to me that I even thought I was interested in that stuff, rather than being hungry. The two feel the same now.

Not being extremely hungry for a few days doesn't mean it's suddenly over and that everything after that is bingeing. Your EH will taper down and fluctuate.

Feel free to add!!!"
Does this sounds like hyper metabolism,"Ok, so for the past 8 months or so I cut my calories by a lot to wanna look skinny. I started at 145 and I am now at 115. I would eat 1400-1900 for the first 3 months or so and then these past 3-4 months I dropped it to 900-1200 a day. I noticed in these past two months I’ve been noticing a lot more muscle weakness, fatigue, hair thinning/loss, always tired, face swelling, joint pain, bloating in the stomach and constantly having to urinate. I went to the doctors and they couldn’t seem to find anything wrong in blood works but they mentioned it could be my diet. I’ve talked to a lot of people that have dealt with eating disorders and they believe I have anorexia, so when I heard that news I decided to try and do everything I can to get back to being healthy. I would say for the past three weeks I’ve been upping my calories about 200 a day. I am now up to eating 2200 a so I thought I would gain weight seeing how it’s a big jump from where I started, turns out I’ve only been losing/staying the same weight. I’ve been waking up 2 times a night having to urinate and sweating, plus the occasional headache. I talked to my sister about this issue and she believes I’m in hyper metabolism. I was 117 last week, yesterday I was 114 and as of today I’m 115. I’m still upping 200 calories per day but not really seeing too much weight gain. Does anyone know if this does seem like hyper metabolism and if so any advice would be appreciated."
People who give advice..,"Seems to be common thing for people in recovery (supposed) to give plethora of advice on these subreddits, when not actually following through on their own irl. Do we spend much time in these spaces as means to delay, distract, act vicariously, twirl around in circles, pat each other on the back, and then procrastinate some more.. I'm born from a different generation (X) before inception of reddit  specifically and social media in general so the phenomenon piques my curiosity and/or frustration."
BM but gas is still trapped?,"Sorry if it is TMI but this drives me crazy! During the last few years of my ED and especially now in the recovery I have a lot of trapped gas in general but I don't understand how during the BM it doesn't come out at all?! I feel it is inside a lot but it is still stuck, how is that even possible?   
It only comes out when it wants and mostly later in the day..   
Did anyone else experience something like this?"
Anyone else??,"Anyone else?

Anyone else has periods (family events, trips etc) where you “forget” ab your ed and eat well yet still lost weight??? I dont get it here I am eating way more than my restrictive periods and LOSE weight? I thought at least there would be water/food weight but no…

Anyone else please share experiences 🙏🏻🩵"
Globus Sensation/Lump in throat feeling in recovery?,"I was wondering if anyone experienced this feeling? I have it on and off from the start of my recovery, it is not acid reflux related to me but somehow gas/bloating related. But I can't figure out if it is physical, from the pressure of gas and spasms or from stress/anxiety. But it happens when I have more gas and bloating throughout the day. It is very scary feeling and I was curious if it is just me or did it happen to someone else in recovery?"
Having no choice but to relapse even though I do not wanna,"Having no choice but to relapse even though I do not wanna

Background:my dad is usually in another country bc of his business. Me ,my mom and brother live together and my maternal grandparents are a short walk away. I have been in all-in anorexia recovery for more than 2months. I've been getting so much better recently but about 5 days ago, my dad randomly walked in.HE HAD LITERALLY flown in from another country without telling my mom,me,or my grandparents he is a controlling person, and i really do not know how to say this but basically he has jus been told of my recovery, and basically makes he makes my recovery impossible in ways I can not describe, like I LITERALLY have NO other choice but to relapse."
Strong and painful physical hunger in the morning,"If I don’t eat a LOT for one day, the next day I wake up, I feel soooo hungry. The hunger is so strong that I can’t sleep and it’s so painful but I’m so tired that I literally put bread in my mouth and go back to sleep WITHOUT SWALLOWING THE BREAD and just chew on it as I fall in and out of consciousness lol. I’m like so tired that I constantly fall back asleep but the hunger wake m up and I chew. This sounds bizarre omg.. But some morning it’s so bad it’s really hard to deal with :( the hunger feels like someone pulling my stomach away and turning it :( and it’s hard to eat a lot cause my mouth would get so dry that many times I almost choked on the food lol"
am I recovering too easy?,"I get this feeling a lot, I've been in recovery for a month and whilst I relapsed once or twice. Joined by throwing out food on a few occasions, now I've been pretty full effort in my outpatient recovery. I eat my meal plan, everything handed to me I eat until the plate is clean even if I feel sick half way through.

I eat all my snacks, and additionally snack on nut mix throughout the day which isn't even apart of my meal plan. I feel like I shouldn't find it this easy? sure the food guilt is insane, and I keep tracking calories in my head though I actively used a marker to cover the nutritional labels on everything in the house.

Been taking Olanzapine to calm down around food / post-food towards the last meal of the day.

I don't reject food, I actually crave it 24/7 now, I used to be a fussy eater pre-ED (to the point I never ate noodles up until 14 and still was abrasive of flavouring. Or pizza) now I can and will eat anything that's set infront of me.

I feel like I should be struggling more, or trying to challenge it or something. Like, I lost over a third of my body weight, dealt with hair thinning, collapsing, numbness, cold etc all these symptoms of malnourishment. 

But also the, not trying foods I wanted to or wanted to eat, not enjoying myself at family's and friends for the entire year. For everything to be easier in a month or at least start resolving a LOT.

I'm terrified of recovering physically and not at all mentally, as the mental part is really all that's present right now. I'm just tired."
Going vegan as harm reduction?,"I hope I don’t get hated on for this and also if it’s harmful please let me know


But I’ve tried recovery countless times now, through many years with many different approaches but no success. I’m starting to think I should begin by trying harm reduction instead of having full recovery as my goal, because I always end up discouraged and I relapse. I’ve been thinking about going vegan and I don’t know if it’s a bad idea. I think it would help me feel in control of my diet without being too overwhelming. I’m aware this would be quasi recovery but I still think it’s better than what I’m doing right now. I’m still a little afraid it could go wrong but I don’t see how exactly. Am I looking at the situation with ED goggles?"
Recovering alone and I need some advices :(,"I'm a couple of months into recovery, I'm underweight and I don't have a period for a year now.. :( I have been undereating for 2-3 years but mostly in the last year. I lost my fat reserves but muscle mass is ok.  
  
I struggle with digestion issues regarding to too much gas (simethicone doesn't help, the gas is constantly present) and it gives me nausea so I don't have appetite at all and zero hunger. I'm eating only in a slight surplus to my daily energy needs since it is so hard to eat more when I'm feeling like this. I also focus on small meals throughout the day, mostly carbs, protein and fats and fruit/veg in a really small amounts for now.  
  
When can I expect for the digestion to catch up at least a bit so that I can eat more? :( Any advices on what to do? Will the digestion heal at all with the extra energy that I'm giving to my body but at the slower pace? Do I need to restore weight first or will the digestion fix itself during the process?  
I'm really desperate, I just want to feel hungry again and not so gassy and full all the time. :("
Anorexia recovery makes you fat?,Someone who had recovery said that she got fat from it..
Why people say that recovery is worst?,I saw many people who had recovery that they hate it and wish they never did this. I want recovery but at the same time I don't cuz I'm too scared. Bc I get so angry when I have food in my stomach and I don't like it
Calories cap and recovery,"When I increase calories cap, I can't return to my previous cap (less calories cap). Why so? It is insanity? Laziness?"
Need Advice or Resources,"I’m not quite sure what to do, but my sister is developing anorexia and I can’t find any solid resources for me to help her. Im not a mental health professional, I don’t know how to help someone in crisis. I know that isn’t my job, but what I mean is… what do I say? 

When she’s looking at her tummy in the mirror or asking me if she’s lost or gained weight? What do I say when she confides in me how little she ate one day and laments over eating more than one meal the next? What do I say when she notices her body changing and her clothes don’t fit her anymore? I don’t know what to say, I don’t want to somehow trigger her further. 

So far I’ve been doing my best with what I know. We talk a lot about her body dysmorphia. I tell her that I wish she could see herself through my eyes. I read the information available online. I don’t comment on anything she does or doesn’t eat. I give her a safe space to vent. There have been times I feel I didn’t handle this situation correctly. I changed my approach quite a bit each time. Focusing on harm reduction has helped a lot.  

I just need to know what to say to the tough questions. I feel helpless right now."
weight redistribution/belly fat,"im 17f and i think im at or almost to my pre ed weight ive been up and down with recovery so idk if that has anything to do with this like maybe my body doesnt feel safe yet but idk, anyways my arms  and legs look similar maybe even more toned because ive been lifting like especially my arms are thin but my stomach is way more fat than its ever been and i know some of it is bloat but likee ive always been a small person and had a flatish stomach and small waist so im scared it will never go back to how it was and ill always have this weird fat distribution in my stomach and be really uncomfortable with myself"

Extreme hunger,"Please tell me this stops, how long does it last? I'm losing my mind, it's ruining my life"
Rapid Weight Gain/Honouring Extreme Mental Hunger,"20 year old (M) suffering with anorexia/bulimia for about 1 year now and I started recovery 6 weeks ago. I finally had enough and wanted to recover. I honored my mental hunger as I read all the reddit posts and for 6 weeks straight I was eating high fat, sugary junk foods. My EH is still crazy high (more mental hunger than physical). Lately I have been having awful digestive discomfort, night sweats and really bad water retention and bloating espically in my ankles and legs. I have gained 10kg in 6 weeks and all the fat has gone to my stomach and face. its honestly freaking me out, I've committed this far and don't want to fall back into my restrictive habits.  
My EH is still redciluiously high (probably eating 5k calories a day (mainly all junk food) and I feel like it won't ever stop considering I'm bascially weight restored, but still all I think about is food I feel disgusting. "
Losing family members/relationships,"I 17F have been hospitalised for anorexia around 2 years ago and have been attempting to recover with a medical treatment team (doctor, dietician, psychologist). I seem to be stuck in a situation where I’m either restricting or eating enough but addicted and constantly over exercising. I’m stuck in a cycle of having great days and making improvements and then falling back into my behaviours. It has been a very long two years and overtime my mom (single parent) has slowly started losing faith and trust in me (completely understandable) to the point where she has caught me doing horrible things (sneakily exercising, throwing away food, sneaking food after overexercising) and our relationship is now so fractured to the point where we live in the same house but she’s completely given up on me and prefers to pretend I don’t exist. Has anyone had any experience with this and any way I could possibly explain to her how hard I’m trying to get better and how much I hate lying to her. I don’t understand what’s so wrong with me and why I can’t stop these stupidly addictive behaviours that make me feel like such a horrible person. I don’t want her to hate me for the rest of my life but I don’t know how to get her to forgive me or understand."
Forced recovery as an adult,"Okay, forced isn’t quite the right word, but my parents made it clear that if I decided not to recover then I would lose their support and be choosing to cut my family off. That’s not an option for me, I at least value my relationship with my family over my ED if nothing else. And they also are my source of health insurance at the moment lol. 

My parents recently found out about how my anorexia relapse because of an (mostly unrelated) ER trip where I came clean to them. Only because I wanted to give the ER staff the full story to be able to help me, and my parents happened to be in the room, otherwise I would’ve never said anything to them. I usually live alone but now I’m staying at my parents’ house for a for a week? Several weeks? I’m too afraid to ask what they expect and I think they don’t want to bring it up either. 

I was hospitalized and then did FBT when I was a young teen, but it’s been 10 years and now I’m 23. The difference between then and now is, I don’t really feel like I’m in physical danger like I was when I was a teen. I told them I was struggling the first time because I was truly so tired and unwell and physically couldn’t continue on. This time, I’ve been maintaining my BMI in the same few pounds for months, it’s underweight but not nearly as bad as the last time, and I like the way things are going. I have a routine, I feel like I have things under control, I’m not losing weight, I have my period and my labs are all fine. I know eating as few calories a day as I was isn’t the most healthy thing in the world, but I was making it work. 

But I feel like I’m back where I was when I was a teen, but now with MUCH less support (I weight restored the first time in an inpatient setting and saw therapists/dieticians all day every fay) and much less motivation because I think I’m fine and don’t need any of this. I also just feel pathetic needing to stay with my parents as an adult and be supervised while eating. I haven’t been arguing back like I did when I was younger when they tell me to eat, mostly because I don’t want to cause conflict and also because I don’t think I’m eating enough above maintenance to actually gain. But I think that’s led my parents to believe I’m fine and want to get better, and I feel SO alone and in so much pain because I’m terrified of gaining any weight and I don’t want to be doing this at all. I have a therapist I see virtually once every two weeks, I’m not willing to pay for more than that at the moment because I don’t even want to get better so why bother. 

As I write this, it’s the middle of the night and I’m considering packing up and heading back to my apartment to go back to living my lonely anorexic life. I know that would really upset everyone in my family and I don’t want that, but it’s so tempting. And it makes me feel guilty that I’m not doing everything in my power to get back to restricting. I almost wish I was inpatient and had no choice in the matter, then I would at least have “permission” to work on recovering. 

Has anyone else been in this situation before, not wanting to get better but not really having the willpower to resist help? Specifically if you experienced this while not a minor, since I know minors have much less choice in the matter. Thank you!"
Day 4 recovery,"Yesterday was a total fail I was in a deficit at the end of the day and exercised too much. The worst part is that I didn’t feel bad about it.

Today I decided to have a normal breakfast instead of a restrictive one but was still a normal amount of cal therefore not helping in me gaining weight.

I counted cal as always and feel like sht. Im dealing with extreme hunger and yesterday I almost passed out from hunger even when I had more food than usual for lunch/breakfast. I can do recovery but my brain doesn’t want to. 

Tomorrow I would normally run in the morning but I have an event so my mind is only focusing on which hour do I have to wake up earlier to fit in my run so I don’t skip.

Im just sharing this because Im bored, comments here don’t help at all, the only one who can help me is me and Im so afraid of weight gain that I can’t think straight. Anyways, Im going to keep trying because I look ugly at this point."
Problems with Gas in recovery :(,"Please tell me if it is normal to be so gassy in recovery after low calorie intake for a few years. Some gas can go out but most of it is trapped and it doesn't cause pain but I get nausea from it and I can't eat properly and I need to gain weight since I'm underweight and return my period. :(  
Is that normal and why is it happening, what is creating so much gas and why it is not coming out? I'm not visually bloated (maybe a little), I'm not intolerant to some foods, I'm not consuming too much fibre and I have normal daily bms. Gas-x doesn't make much change, I feel like it iritates my tummy more. I'm feeling constant gas from when I wake up and sometimes I can't sleep cause it moves through my intestines. Please help, tell me if it will get better with time, eating more and weight restoration? :("
Venting / Relapsing,"I’ve been struggling with my ED for almost 10 years, now I’m finally in recovery for one year of healthy eating and going to the gym but recently I changed jobs and I’ve been struggling since. My other colleagues are very skinny and they don’t eat but smoke and drink coffee. I know it’s sounds very cliche but it’s true. Im the only one that eats lunch at work and it makes me sick. I feel extremely fat eating around them. I also have naturally big boobs (32DD) and that’s really what started my ED. I thought if I stopped eating my boobs would shrink but now I have the same amount of boobs, ass and toned thighs because I started gym. 
I can’t vent to my boyfriend because he’s aware of my condition (met me at 90lbs now at 130) and he always tells me I look fine but I keep thinking to myself and believe I’m very fat. Every time I bring up my thoughts on the issue he would get upset. I also work in the fashion industry so that doesn’t help me at all. I have nobody to talk to because my friends keep telling me I look fine. I just feel so alone. I think I’m gonna relapse.

Severe gut problems,"I’m sure a lot of you can relate, but I’ve been in recovery for about a year now and the amount of gut issues I have is effecting my every day life. It’s a battle between severe diarrhea or severe constipation. I just wanted to see if anyone is in the same boat? I’m more constipated than anything. My gut just does not wanna work. :("
Anorexia recovery,"How was your experience during recovery? (Bloating, metabolism, etc..)"
Recovery,"I, a 5’ 10” male, am currently in the recovery process after losing about 20 pounds in 2-3 months from dysmorphia-induced disordered eating (136 to 118). Refeeding has been difficult, but I’m making progress. Maintaining a high protein intake and trying to work in some light strength training here and there. Currently averaging about 2300-2400 calories a day and doing my best to get them from healthy sources.

This has been my first experience with any sort of ED, and I have a few questions. 

How long should I expect recovery to take? Hyper-metabolism is not fun!

What physical changes, milestones, or pitfalls should I look out for? 

Will the weight I regain come back as abdominal  body fat or distribute more evenly as lean muscle?"
Recovery day 3,"Hi this is my third day in recovery, here are some wins:

- Ate late at night beyond my calorie maintenance yesterday 
-Ate fear foods in a normal quantity 
-Overcame the urge to vmt 
-Ate a snack unplanned 

Here are some things that still need work:

- I jogged for 10 km after having breakfast because I had already eaten so much at midnight and felt bad for having breakfast with fear food included 
-I had an intense anxiety after eating an unplanned snack and thought about compensation later
-Chose “healthy” options instead of just having cheesecake and ice cream available 
-Didn’t give into my extreme hunger at midnight cause I just had a big snack that was totally unplanned after dinner

Even If I did these mistakes, I still ate way more than I would usually do and I feel like Im progressing in my recovery. Im doing this thing on my own so it’s incredibly hard. I have to do stuff for college and this recovery stuff is occupying my mind SOO MUCH. I WILL RECOVER ;)"
How can my boyfriend help support me?,I am an anorexic girl and live with my boyfriend. I am struggling with my eating disorder and my boyfriend wants to know how to help. We live together and he sees my struggles. He doesn’t know a lot about anorexia and I’m not sure how to explain it. Any advice on how I could explain it or how he could support me?
Small Relapse,"Hey y’all. I am struggling, after 6 months of doing a pretty good job in recovery, I started eating less again for a few weeks. My body got pissed and did the whole fight or flight reaction, so I started eating more again but promptly then shifted into over-exercise, so that adrenal response is back again.

Super bummed out. Any encouragement or experience would be appreciated. I’m an exhausted, insomniac right now and have some anxiety.

Side note - I can’t believe I allowed people to convince me I had “adrenal fatigue” for like a year and a half before figuring out I had an eating disorder. When I eat and rest and recover I have zero symptoms."

weight redistribution,"when does it start to move out to other areas of the body? I'm hoping it's normal but my stomach is very distended and so are my sides and lower back. Basically all around my waist since starting outpatient recovery (officially at the start of this month, but was trying to do so since this time last month)

my limbs are all the same-looking, but my abdomen, and waist as a whole is driving me into anxious meltdowns a lot. Especially when having to get changed, shower or just,, exist as I can feel unfamilar weight around my waist.

I thought it was just bloating, but it's seeming less and less likely as my lovehandles are already bigger and my bowel movements are more regular.

I just feel very alone, gross, uncomfortable and built like gru or Mr krabs rn lol. appreciate anyone else's experiences, or advice on this."
How can I support/help a friend with an ED? (TW),"Hello there - as the title says, a good friend of mine has been showing signs of an ED over the past year.

At first it was small things and it wasn't as obvious, because she is naturally skinny, but as of now, she has lost a lot of weight and is obsessed with working out, keeping a certain weight and is afraid of gaining it again.
Over the past year, she has began to slowly open up to me and share her true feelings about her body and gaining weight. 

At the begining, I thought it was a (sadly) normal disturbed relationship with food and diet culture, but it has turned out to be much more severe. She recently had a big change in her life, which prevents her of contiuning her routine of over-excercising and controlling her food. This has caused her to spiral again.

I appreciate that she shares those feelings with me, but I feel like she is looking for validation, which I can not give her in conscience. So now, I am looking for advice. How can I handle the situation and support/help her without scaring her away?

I thought maybe some of you have thoughts on what support/help from friends you would wish for."
Refeeding weight gain feels too fast.,"Hello, could someone offer  advice on dealing with rapid weight gain during in patient refeeding..

"recovery, relapse, and extreme hunger in college","ever since i came back to college, i’ve been relapsing in and out of old ED behaviors. after a few days of restriction, extreme hunger kicks in at full force and i devour literally everything in sight before going down to the dining halls for more bc i’m still not satisfied. both the restriction and reactive hunger’s made it impossible to focus on college. i’ve always been a straight-a student and grades have always been my top priority, but my ED is consuming my life. i have a paper due in two days that i haven’t started, but just today, i completely lost control and did nothing but eat when i should have been working. im lying in bed now, with my stomach painfully distended, and all i can think about is how much weight i’m going to gain from tonight. 

ever since i’ve weight restored, it’s become harder and harder to justify my EH + giving into EH to myself. i was born with a naturally slim physique that i maintained most of my life (minus ED years), but now i’m bigger than i’ve ever been and idk how to cope or be okay with that. my mom, who just 2 months ago was crying and begging me to eat a single bite of my dinner, told me last week she would help me diet if i wanted her to. it made me feel so gross and ashamed to know that i’ve gained as much as i have, and i honestly was so happy when i found myself unconsciously restricting… only to find it all come crashing down in these stupid binges. 

not to mention, i’m absolutely screwed for my paper. i cant focus on anything but my weight; all i’m thinking about at any given minute is how i hate myself for letting my body physically recover. 

does anyone have any tips, advice, or experience with recovering during college or work? i was diagnosed with anorexia over the summer and considered taking a semester off to focus on recovery, but my parents and i have always been overachievers and i ultimately decided to prioritize my academics… something that has NOT been working out, bc i cant focus on school with my ED anyway. taking a temporary leave of absence is near impossible too, because i’m an international student on financial aid so there’s a lot of complications that withdrawing would cause. 

but i don’t know how much longer i can go on like this. i keep cycling between restricting, binging, and a whole other set of binging then purging via exercise. i cant focus in class, i cant meet deadlines, and i cant write like i used to. it’s like a fog has entered my brain where i either just feel completely empty from restricting or painfully stuffed from binging. i don’t know what to do."
how do i boost metabolism after recovering?,"i recovered from my ed about 2 years ago now but its been closer to quasi recovery. i’m not afraid of food or weight gain anymore, but i still eat around 1200 calories most days (not intentionally but that just tends to be the amount i eat) which i know isn’t enough and i know i need to eat more. my problem is that when i do eat more i gain massively. i’ve upped my cals to 1600+ recently and i’ve felt a lot better, however i’m so bloated, i look about 6 months pregnant (i’m not joking). i know that’s normal but i’m scared it won’t ever go away and if i keep eating like this i’ll keep gaining forever and it’ll never plateau. how do i increase my metabolism so i can eat a normal amount like i have been recently and maintain my weight instead of gaining? (or how long will it take for me to stop gaining/bloating when consistently eating this much?)"
Cavities causing me to reconsider my recovery.,"hello, i really needed somewhere to write about this because it's really weighing on me and i didn't know where else to let it off my chest. i went to the dentist the other day and i had a cavity. for a while I've been having ""almost cavities"" as the dentist put it. i brush my teeth every morning and every night, i floss every night. within the last 6 months or so, with the help of my boyfriend, have started recovering from Anorexia. he's been there every step of the way and i owe so much to him. as soon as i heard the word cavity and filling i could only think about how if i didn't eat anything, i couldn't have a cavity. I've been struggling with my recovery recently and every meal is just becoming harder and harder. my boyfriend pointed out that vitamin deficiencies cause my not eating is most likely what is causing my cavity and the ""almost cavities"" that I've had in the past. I'm still finding it really hard to continue eating to solve those vitamin deficiencies. my brain just wants me to stop eating so that i can't cause myself any more cavities. i don't really know what to do. I'm on the edge of completely relapsing and i figured here might be a good place to get some advice from someone who may understand the roller coaster of emotions that I'm going through right now. my boyfriend is great but he can only understand so much because he hasn't ever suffered with anything like this. thank you for reading and any advice that you have to offer."

Distractions during/after eating?,"I'm doing outpatient recovery at home, following a weight restoration mealplan. So I'm sedentary for the most part due to not being allowed to waste any energy my body is getting from the food.

I've mainly been watching YouTube videos on my laptop whilst eating, or something else. But it gets be stupidly upset when I realised how 'quick' I think I've eaten if the entire thing hasn't finished when I'm done eating. Or I've not taken a long time to finish.

Post-food, the anxiety I get is a mix of food guilt after and the hyper focus on my how stomach is bloated and body swollen.

My family consists of my grandmother, 24yo brother, 12yo sister and I (17) who all have different hobbies and spend our times differently. I don't think spending time with eachother when eating is realistic, or much different from if I ate alone watching something.

what do you guys do, during or after food as distractions ?"
Dealing with being taller than your bf (as a girl),Has anyone else experienced this? It makes me feel so big and terrible about myself. Everything about him is good but I feel so upset by this one thing a lot of the time. We have been together for 2 years and I'm scared what my extremely judgemental mother will say if she meets him irl.
Is extreme hunger inevitable,I have been on and off with recovery and relapsing and everytime I hit extreme hunger i try to control my cravings and the ED wins and I loose weight with some sort of “control”. This time I went all in and gained back all the weight but feel guilty. Is extreme hunger basically just … inevitable? No matter how much I restrict and whatever it will still occur right ?
Pictures,"I discharged from iop in august and have continued weight restoring since. I went out with friends this weekend and one of them had a camera. We were taking some really cute pictures and all but once I got them back, I was so devastated. I was so scared of what my body looked like in them. I feel like my body perception changes from mirror to mirror but for there to be a picture, it’s frozen in time, in my natural being & that was so triggering. Any recommendations or thoughts would be so helpful right now"
They say if it scares you then do it but I can’t help but feel none of that applies to me because I’m a normal weight,That’s all… all these recovery tips feel like they are for everyone but me. I just don’t know what to do when I feel like I still need to adhere to certain diet rules and regulations and I don’t know
recovery questions,"i've (16f) been in recovery for around 6 weeks, so still quite early in, and i still have a long way to go in terms of fully healing mentally and physically! i don't have a fixed meal schedule or plan, i just eat freely and what i want according to my hunger and fullness cues, but i make sure i'm satisfied too, and i do my best to honour mental and physical hunger overall. i don't think i have eh for now, and maybe this is wishful thinking but i feel that my hunger/fullness/satiety cues are regulating a lot better too, so i'm eating quite intuitively in a sense?

but are there benefits to weight restoring/recovering faster? especially in regards to period recovery and growing taller as a teenager, and also weight redistribution.

i'm not weight restored yet, but i am steadily gaining weight as time goes on. i'm not intentionally trying to stall or reduce the rate of weight gain but i know if i were to weight restore faster it means eating to the point of physical discomfort, so i'm unsure if i should push it?

does restoring faster mean i will be able to return to a 'pre-ed state' faster?

i know i will most likely overshoot especially to get my period back too but the sooner i get it back the better, the sooner i can 'resume' a pre-ed life i'm guessing?

will i need to focus on certain macros eg. fats to gain my period back, or will eating more in general be enough, and how common is it to grow taller in recovery?

i'm afraid this will cause me to track or pay more attention on foods/macros again it will cause me to overthink and overcomplicate eating which might lead to restriction. i'm concerned about stunted growth and period recovery (has been missing over a year now) so i want to grow taller while i still have the chance to since i'm turning 17 at the end of this year. i do know stress levels also play a role, though being a perfectionist presents a challenge to try not to stress about all aspects of my life, but especially my studies as i have entered sixth form.

how long does it usually take for weight to redistribute?

i can tell most of my weight is going to my top half which makes sense, but clothes are fitting weird and it is 'harder' and uncomfortable moving around due to the disproportionate distribution and still getting used to the new sensory aspects

idk... i guess i just want to 'get it over with' to be able 'catch up' with life and resume normalcy. i'm kind of looking for reasons to keep continuing or to speed up the process if it's a good idea lol; other than that i am still working on the mental barriers and building a healthy relationship with myself, but i hope i'm still making progress overall!"
metabolism question,"Hi, i recently went into recovery for ana about a month ago. I was in a PHP and on a meal plan. I recently had to stop treatment due to insurance issues. Im trying to maintain my current weight as I didnt gain much while I was there. Is it likely that my metabolism has been damaged by the change in eating? Im just not really sure what to do and jusg want to maintain."
Extreme hunger ended or relapse,I had extreme hunger for about one month. All of a sudden one day I thought I’m going to train my brain to stop craving unnecessary foods. And it worked. Ever since then I’ve been only eating 3 meals and lost weight. I’m confused and a little scared. Feels wrong but also right. But I finally feel in control
Slightly pitting edema in face,So idk what's going on I've been recovering for 4 months now and like a week ago my face blew up and now I have slight pitting edema in my face. When I press on my forehead there will be a small dent from my finger and lasts maybe 1 min or so. People say that edema may happen in recovery but whenever I take anti-histaminr pills there's less edema/puffiness in my face? So idk if I'm experiencing a symptom of recovery or something beyond like an allergy or something with my immune system.
my sister said some nice things to me,"lemme preface this by saying not everyone will find my sister's words comforting or helpful, but it was for me!

recently, i asked my sister if i look ugly or weird when i'm fatter. she said i look the same in that sense, and that if i ever think i look fat, just think i'm a teletubby. coming from anyone else, that would've sounded rather insulting. but she said that with good intentions and i know she doesn't see me any differently. the visual in my head was also so cute, i couldn't help but laugh. 

so i found her words really cute, just sharing it if anyone cracks a smile because of them too. 

also, a reminder that sometimes EDs will cloud your perspective and make you think you look worse than you really do. i definitely don't think anything bad about others in bigger bodies, but for some reason my standard is different when i'm being critical about myself."
how does anyone deal with their job in recovery? feeling stuck..,"I’ve recently been trying to eat more but eating larger meals makes me SO fricking tired and fatigued that I need a nap after eating. Even then I find that I’m tired throughout the day.

I haven’t upped my intake to this much since last year or so. I have started eating more since this weekend and haven’t been back at work yet and I’m terrified that I’m not going to be able to push through the fatigue and fluffy headness.

I feel like this disorder has made it so hard for me to make any kind of decision ever… like I can’t decide if I want to just tell work for this week that I’m unwell just to get me used to this higher intake for now (I know it’ll probably take much longer but at least I’ll get a bit more familiar with dealing with this). Or, if I should even just contemplate taking some time off work in recovery even though that might sound a bit extreme and I don’t know what I’d do with myself. Feeling really discouraged and meaningless"
encouragement,"Can someone please tell me that recovery is possible, someone in their late twenties or older preferably. I feel so hopeless I need some encouragement or proof that a real enjoyable productive life is possible if you go through recovery. Is it possible to be happy?"
My lack of appetite is triggered by when things are rough between my boyfriend and I - we broke up last night,"i have been anticipating this breakup for a couple of days just because of how things have gone with him leaving for uni and tbh, i don’t feel awful. however, looking at pictures of us together makes me feel ill and upset and my appetite has completely vanished since last night. i don’t know what to do."
Waves of hunger,Hey I have a question. I am in Recovery for several month now and I eat intuitively. For the last weeks I thought I lost my pithole hunger but since Friday I got it back. I struggle with constipation again which was also solved. Is it normal that there are ups and downs like that?
"I get so easily fatigued in recovery if I miss any snacks/meals, is this normal?","Making it super clear it's not relapsing or on purpose, but happens as my family is muddled and struggling with providing me outpatient care and I do as well. (never was inpatient btw)

I've been having 3 meals and 3 snacks with around 2-3 hr gaps between. Usually incorporating high energy stuff since it's weight restoration.

If I miss even one snack now though, the physical unwellness is insanely fast and I'm so confused? a month ago before recov it'd take days for that to happen, now i get splitting headaches, stomach growling, chest tightness and heartburn? I had breakfast this morning, nutrigrain and toast and missed my snack due to some family conflicts and then visiting GP, it's lunch time now so I'll have my next meal soon and everything hurts.

Is this supposed to happen? why is this happening? I had a LOT of extreme hunger I honoured the past two days."
I Can’t Stop Hiding Food,"I [16F] have been hospitalized twice and in recovery for six years. After my second discharge from a hospital in early 2021, I was doing really well for a long time and eating a lot of foods I never thought I would (such as ice cream or butter). 

Earlier this year (around March or so), my dietitian weighed me. When my parents saw the number, they started freaking out because they thought I was underweight, even though I’m pretty sure I wasn’t. Anyways, they still increased my meal card substantially, and to cope with this change, I began hiding food again, which I hadn’t done in years. At first, I only hid a little bit every so often, but it’s gotten out of control. I now hide and throw away large portions of my food at every meal, although most of the time I’m indifferent to what I’m eating and don’t even really want to hide it; it has just become part of my routine, I guess.

I just don’t know what to do. I only started doing this to cope with my increased meal card and avoid gaining weight, but I think I’ve actually lost a lot of weight since March, yet I  still feel compelled to hide food even if it’s not “necessary” anymore. I also feel really guilty because of all the money I cause my parents to throw away by restricting, but that never stops me. I’m so conflicted because I know I will become hospitalized again if I continue restricting. However, gaining weight is so scary, and restricting makes me feel so powerful. I just don’t know what to do."
How to start recovery?,"Hi! I have decided that I want to gain some weight because all of my closet is big on me and I don’t want to throw stuff away. Also my mom lashed at me today saying that I was going to die and stuff.

Should I just eat what I want? I rlly want to eat a whole tub of ben and jerrys in one sitting, or a large domino’s pizza. I want to gain in a healthy way but also enjoy the process of recovery, so my body and mind feel satisfied.

Im deeply scared and have an inmense fear of weight gain but I know I have to do it now, or else I will die. Some tips to start recovery and stick to it until at least I gain a few kilos?"
Recovering??,"Ive never been formally diagnosed but I developed an eating disorder early 2020 and it continued getting worse til I was at my all time low in mid 2022 I stayed underweight until mid 2023 when I randomly decided that I don’t have one anymore (mostly thanks to smoking & other substances). I’ve gotten my period back and know I’ve gained some weight so I feel like I’ve recovered, but I actually don’t know if I have"
How do you feel about counting calories?,"Our 14yo has anorexia and along with all the therapy and doctors appts and all it’s been a struggle getting him to want to eat. My husband suggested that we could tell him he needs to eat at least x many calories a day to try to help, but I’m really worried that would backfire and just make him more focused on how many calories are in things (if he’s not already) and end up eating less. What worked for you guys?"
Why should I eat sugar?,"I have reached weight I don't like and want to cut out added sugar again. Still have no periods. I feel like I ""have to be skinny "" to make it easier to care for me because I am disabled."
Recovery,I’ve tried recovery so many times ending up always relapsing. what makes it so difficult is that i feel good living like this.. i know this isn’t healthy but my ed brain makes me think i don’t need to fully recover when i can happily live like this and maintain a thin body i can manage to live with..
Recovery makes me suffer more than my ED I feel like,"The EH or hypermetabolism or whatever I have right now is killing me. I feel horrible, stuffed yet very hungry, disgusting, depressed, and puffy. I don’t know if I can do this. I feel like I felt better when I restricted and exercised all the time. I don’t know why I chose to do this because I’m suffering in my body and I’m stuck: I can’t go back because I’m too far in recovery, yet any sign of not eating enough makes my current situation so much worse. I can’t I can’t I cant. I just can’t keep looking like a blob and I’ve been in recovery for 4 months now and every time I feel like I get better it worsens after a few days :( help"
Is my dietitian judging me?,"Off the bat, I know this is going to sound silly….

But I have this fear that my dietitian will be upset if i gain weight. I have been weight restored for a bit and my weight is pretty stable but I always worry that if I do gain weight now she will be disappointed. We have spoken about set point theory before and in my mind this “should be my set point” so if it’s not I feel like she will think I did something wrong. I know it’s silly, but I just can’t help it. 

Any advice/ support would be great!"
"Being puffy, saggy, bloated, swollen and retaining water",How long will this last? My face is wide and puffy from the water retention. I hate being ugly like this. I've been recovering for 4 months now. Although it's definitely better than what it used to be I'm not satisfied with looking like a blob still. People say it sometimes takes like 6 months up to a year. Terrible terrible
Lack of PMS symptoms,So when I was deep in my anorexia I completely lost my period due to malnutrition. And I've been in recovery for a few months now and started menstruating again and I've noticed it really just...comes out of nowhere. It arrives around the same time every month but before I relapsed I would experience sore breasts and painful cramps and maybe some mood swings 5-7 days before but now I don't know I'm bleeding until I use the bathroom or change my underwear before showering. Do any of you guys experience this?
Hairstyle tips,"So I’ve got some new growth coming in, but my hair is less than half the thickness it was. It’s long and thin and just so depressing.

Thanks!"

FBT In-patient Re feeding Trauma,"My 13 yo Daughter is currently an in patient being treated for anorexia nervosa.
I have mixed feeling about her program and treatment and I'm desperately seeking advise from people that have done  FBT as their treatment, Either successful or unsuccessful. I struggle with the amount of trauma she is exposed to as it seems to be making her anorexia more fierce than ever, so extreme in fact she can no longer sit in front of her meals without melting down and start self harm and wanting to kill herself... this is soo distressing for us to endure. Granted we have managed to gain some desperately needed kg's and for this I am so 🙏,  but the path we are heading down appears to be Turing a relativly mild anorexic  child significantly underweight into a significantly anorexic child with restored weight pluss suicidal ideology. How can this be a good thing or even a valid treatment. They clearly explain due to cognitive impairment there is no benefit to introducing psycological support, this I get but wtf is it with freaking these poor kids out day in day out until they mentally crack.   I couldn't take the abuse anymore and I put my foot down and said enough. I feel like as a child if you a forced to endure relentless physical pain (bloated,  full, nausea constipation ) mentally traumatised by the sheer volume expectations with 150% calorie replacement (up to 900mls of liquid ) for skipped meals etc and worst of all your voice and plea  go unheard , then you are physically restrained and forced via gastric nasal tube to be fed against your will, it's no surprise death feels like  better option.. As a parent it's hard to make choices that
Sufficiently combat the destructive impact of anorexic behaviour, and  there is no doubt our kids are significantly impaired and unable to make decisions for themselves,  but we must draw a line that should not be crossed too many times without first looking at what dynamic is in front of us. My Daughter is a master of crafts when it comes to making food disappear. So Good. that in four days she managed to hide almost half of her meals in her sleeves pockets, butter under her fingernails mashed potatoes in her pockets even whilst being supervised.. protocol says more food and the the child has an even bigger mountain to climb and then they are mentally defeated and start going backwards. I'm extremely challenged at the moment between treating anorexia and preserving the identity of my daughter.. this is something I've spent many a sleepless night pondering. I'm struggling with the notion that FBT refeeding stage 1, takes a flame thrower to everything in the house ED /child/ bare human rights/voice/ and it is relentless- then the strategy is to pick up the charged prices and see if it can be put back together again.i d love to hear your stories through treatment and recovery."

Well I was…I just realized today I have relapsed. I have been recovered so long that I didn’t recognize the warning signs. Im going through so many different personal issue (loss of a childhood friend who went way too soon), divorce, health issues…I now realize how much I lost and how long I’ve gone without eating. It’s been so long since recovery for me, I’m not sure what to do or where to start. I feel I have no support system at this age going through a divorce.

But now I can't stop and I don't know what to do, because it's not intentional anymore. I wake up everyday thinner and thinner, I'm concerned.

But in my everyday life, I struggle with being intuitive. I rely on meal times and have decision paralysis. Basically, I need some help of how to know what and when to eat on normal days where I have no plans and am at home all day.

private treatment (uk),"hi all! just looking for anybody's experiences with private treatment in the UK (specifically, dietetic support). i'm in a really tough patch currently and i'm starting to worry that this is just going to be my life: forever. to give a brief overview, i was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at 17 and spent 4 looong years with the services trying to gain back my life. i got to a much better point, but due to covid i was discharged earlier than i should've been and told to come back if things started to spiral or i felt like i wasn't in control. since i never really got to the root of the issue, my ED kicked back in extremely viciously and I basically just denied anything was wrong for a year and a half. about 3 months ago, a doctor re-referred me to the services for my relapse... and i can't do this again. 🥲

the first time around, i was 17 & only worked a part time job, so scheduling around work was never really a problem/priority. since leaving the services, i got myself a full-time job with colleagues that i really, really like. i'm still in the probation period, so things like attendance, etc. are incredibly important and scary for me. however, the services in my area are mon-fri 9-5... my working hours, and they're trying to schedule me in to see a dietitian, therapist & psychiatrist once a week, every week whiiiich is just not doable around work. 😅 they're calling 2, 3, 4 times a day whilst i'm trying to work, and keep leaving voicemails about 'whether i'm ready to commit to recovery' or not because i have had to rearrange appointments that i've been given a few days notice for. it's gotten to the point where my phone rings and i *jump* in fear whiiiich is not exactly helping me to help myself. 

it seems as though my only option is going to be to go private, but there don't seem to be a whole lot of resources out there on how to go about private care in an accessible, affordable way. i do not have £200 a week to spend on a separate dietitian & therapist, so i'd need to try and find somebody who could work on both with me or an alternative (i.e. a therapist and the gp working together, maybe?). i can't live like this anymore, but i also don't want to put my life on hold and give up a job that i love and have only just found because of my eating disorder *again*. i just want to be a normal 23 year old, but i'm not capable of making the physical changes on my own... i'm also terrified that if the NHS discharge me and things continue to get worse, i'm not going to be able to go back and i'm going to be forced to just live in quasi forever. 

basically, i just feel very disheartened and worried that this is it for me so... why bother? 🥲 which is definitely not how an ED service should be making you feel. could use a virtual hug and a reminder that relapse doesn't make me a failure lol."
"CBT-E, possibly making my anorexia worse??","I recently started cbte which is the recommended treatment for AN on the nhs (I live in the uk), but I have found that the first few weeks have only been about my physical health, eating a better diet, focussing on reaching a healthy BMI, and the consequences of under eating.  I have to keep a food diary of everything I eat and drink and how I feel about it, and I have also been given a meal plan to follow but k feel like this is somehow making me worse.  I feel like now I am so obsessive with the meal plan and writing everything down makes me worry, and if I eat anything slightly more than what’s on the meal plan it sends me spiralling when what I want from the therapy is just so not overthink food and just eat without obsessing.  I was wondering if anyone else has done cbte / has a similar experience?"

Tips for eating out?,"I’m meeting up with one of my friends on Sunday. We were best friends since we were 5 (We’re 16 now) but a couple months ago she started going to a different school so I don’t see a lot of her anymore. 

We’re going out to eat and I’m very excited to see her, but it’s been a while since I’ve been out to eat and I’m quite nervous. With calories on the menus now and everything I just know I’m going to be adding up and feeling guilty and ill at every bite and I just don’t want that at all.

Does anyone here have any tips for just relaxing or just anything that could make this easier. I really want this to go well."
one year anniversary,"i (20F) still feel weird posting about this but it felt important to recognize hitting this milestone even if i’m still struggling with acceptance. one year ago today i made the decision to recover. i visited with a psychiatrist and began regular therapy again. i made the choice to gain weight and learn how to start a healthy relationship with food. 

I’ll spare the details of how i fell into my crippling years of anorexia but I’ll just say i was in a terrible state physically and mentally this time last year. probably the worst i’ve ever been. now, i am happier and i am healthier by FAR. i want to be clear that i am still struggling though. this last year has been rough. i did, in fact, begin to build a healthy relationship with both food and exercise for the first time in my life. i also gained more weight than i thought i would, or that i initially  wanted to. i know this is a fear for many of us recovering and it certainly was a huge fear of mine too. here are some things that have helped me go through this change in my life. i am still working towards full acceptance but this is what i’ve got so far: 

1) i had never seen my adult body before in a healthy way. this was a huge realization for me. i struggled for years since i was 11 years old with anorexia. i had put my body though SO many unhealthy things that i had never seen what my body would look like when it’s needs were fully met, that is when my body felt truly safe. it just so happens that when i am at my healthiest, my body needs more weight and that is okay. that is what my adult body should look like when it eats a fulfilling diet and practices regular fulfilling exercises. i am not a child anymore and my body is reflecting that.

2) the hardest part of working through recovery is fighting social influence (at least for me). while yes, a HUGE part of this disorder is mental i noticed that much of that is tied to the way that society chooses to highlight and place worth on unhealthily thin women. they are idolized and specialized so much that it’s no wonder those concepts became so engrained in my head. i’ve been slowly but surely changing my definition of what is beautiful. i am careful about what kinds of content i am allowing myself to see. what society has deemed ideal is actually not ideal at all. we are truthfully just overexposed to media. there is nothing wrong at all with a body that is healthy. not fake instagram healthy but real healthy. 

3. healthy looks different on everyone. as much as i hate to admit it this disorder made me unbelievably judgmental of other women in addition to myself. i am ashamed to say that. i have been working so hard to appreciate not only my own body for what it is but also the bodies of the real women around me. i have been finding the beauty in all types of bodies which has helped me tremendously with finding the beauty in my own. this has also helped me a great deal with feeling comfortable around other women as a source of support rather than a source of judgement. 

4. CLOTHES ARE TEMPORARY. this was a huge problem for me as i get very very attached to the clothes that i like. feeling things not fit me in a way that i enjoyed was extremely sad. however, it taught me a good lesson about materialism. clothes are temporary. i donated my clothes that didn’t fit me anymore. because i reminded myself of just how physically and mentally miserable i was when those clothes fit me perfectly. i thanked them for the many good times and sent them on their way. my advice is to slowly but surely buy new clothes that fit in a flattering way. i did this by thrifting since i am on a tight budget. it was and is very hard for me but i find myself constantly reminded that living things take priority. that is, the clothes should be made to fit you, you are NOT made to fit the clothes. similarly, do NOT pay attention to sizing. women’s clothing sizes are bullshit anyway. they are inconsistent at any size and do not matter. cut the size tags out of your clothes. 

5. you are SO much more than any number. this goes for clothing sizes, weight, or measurements of any kind. a number doesn’t tell you what specifically makes you laugh and cry. it can’t tell you your favorite color or how you like your coffee or what your favorite type of weather is. it can’t tell you what your hopes and dreams for your future entail. a number can’t define who you are as a person, it can’t make you a better person or a worse person. this is really hard too but please believe me, it is totally okay to ignore numbers entirely. don’t weigh yourself, don’t measure yourself, and don’t focus on the size of your clothes. none of that is what makes you a memorable or lovable person. 

6. i feel more capable than i have in my entire life up to this point. mentally i feel extraordinarily sharp. physically i feel strong. my hair, skin, and nails are healthier and happier than ever. i feel so much more love for myself than ever before. i am still on the road to full healing but i am proud of how far i have come. please know that this process is very hard  but that it is absolutely worthwhile. it has been rewarding in so many more ways than i ever imagined. i truly feel like a new and improved version of who i was one year ago today. i just needed a place to voice this for a moment. 

thank you if you read all of that. i wish you all the best of luck with your own recovery. sincerely."
Is weight restoration a process? Or are you done when the weight have evened out a bit?,"Been in recovery about a half year. The first months my stomach and face was crazy bloated. I’ve already feel like the weight have evened out. I’ve doubled my bra size. I’ve also have gained a proper toned behind for the first time in my life, probably because I’m actually able to get progress in the gym now that I eat enough.

Anyways, I still feel like my stomach is flabby and bloated. I don’t recall being this aware of my belly/having a flabby belly before I got sick, but maybe my obsession over it is due to the eating disorder? Is it possible that this will pass eventually, or am I finished with weight restoration?"
Ed recovery research,"My name is Kate Roe, I’m a senior at Parsons School of Design in NYC. Throughout my high school and college years I struggled with a severe eating disorder which I eventually sought help for and entered recovery. Now for my senior thesis project in college I’m researching design interventions for how to best help prevent relapse after eating disorder recovery. I’m exploring aspects of accountability, confidence building and community support. I want to make sure my research is informed by people who have experienced eating disorders so I’m conducting short surveys to get a better understanding of what this community has experienced. If you are able to fill out any of these short surveys it would be so appreciated. Your response will remain anonymous! Thank you in advance!

I've been attempting eating more, even though it literally the same thing everyday, ( I'm struggling to take that step into eating everything still ) I eat mostly fruits and vegetables, adding a bit of fats like peanut butter and olive oil but in teaspoons at a time. But I've had this ed for awhile, 16 years, and it already caused physical damage to my body. (Osteoporosis, tooth loss, no menstrual cycle)
I wish I just had an eating plan so I can just eat whats ""normal"" because honestly I feel so lost. I just repeatedly eat the same produce everyday because I don't know where to begin. But I am extremely dizzy almost all the time and have to take deep breaths during the day because ot feels like I'm running out of air. My whole body hurts and my muscles feel like their sunburned and stiff. Its very painful, and my pain tolerance is pretty high. Anybody have this happen to them and if so, whats something I can do? Also any suggestions on meals would be helpful. (Not delivered food though, I am not financially able. I am just a mom of 5 beautiful kids, so no $$$ income.) Thank you."
should i look into professional help?,"i’m 16 and 10 months in recovery. weight restored for a while, but still experiencing extreme hunger. i recovered on my own besides my therapist knowing. since like month 2, i haven’t really been all in. month 2, i was at a weight that i thought was healthy and tried to maintain that for a while. i gained more and have been weight restored since like april. but i’ve had trouble honoring my hunger a lot since because i didn’t feel like i deserved to have sm food at a higher weight. i also started new adhd meds that make it easier to ignore the hunger. i was still eating like a regular amount for a ‘normal person’ but not rlly enough for me. so then a week or two ago i decided to really prioritize honoring all hunger and extreme hungers been hitting hard. i eat before school, but i’m a slow eater and don’t have enough time, so i’m always still hungry after. i usually have a granola bar and cheese stick as snacks in my classes, i feel super uncomfortable eating in class though and it’s hard. then lunch 7th and i get home and eat a tonnn. but i asked my mom if she could look into getting me a dietitian. a lot of times if i’m out doing stuff with my parents, they’ll go a long time without eating and i have to go out of my comfort zone to ask for food. i feel like they think i’m being dramatic and don’t understand how important it is for me to respond to my hunger. got in a fight with my dad bc i was eating icecream and bc i was late to school bc of breakfast. he told me to just have a banana if i’m in a rush, but that would not work for me. i’d feel dizzy in like three hours. when my parents aren’t home or don’t eat with me, it’s rlly hard to come up with meals to make and get the energy to make it with executive function issues. knowing my mom, she’s not gonna look into dietitians unless i keep pushing. would they be able to help me, even though i’m weight restored? i really hate having to recover all alone, not to mention my parents saying triggering shit regardless of me getting upset by it. idk if i should try to get more help or just keep trying my best to eat when i can"
Support Groups in NYC?,Does anyone know of any in-person or virtual support groups based in NYC for folks in AN recovery? Or would anyone in the NYC area want to get together?
Also on the spectrum and can’t eat,"I’m at a beginning point of recovery where I want to get better, for myself and for my partner. I have Asperger’s and I’m at a point where sensory wise nothing sounds or looks good, and when I try to eat I get nauseous and physically ill. But at the same time it’s like a contest in my head to see how long I can go without eating now and then it gets too late and I have a thing about not eating past 7pm because I’m worried about it transferring on the scale the next day."
Fat redistribution & amrnorrhea,Does fat redistribtion happen if you keep exercising? Is it necessary to stop exercising to regain your cycle?
Ideas for challenging cookies?,I bought some oreo cookies today that I really want to challenge with my night snack. I don’t really like milk alone but I meed to pair them with something and I’m too anxious to even think straight. Any ideas for good pairings?
moving up sizes,"soo i’ve been wearing nothing but comfy pajamas and sweatpants for my past month of recovery, but had to put on some formal wear for an event today. i cycled through all the jeans i bought when i was at my lowest weight, as well as a few that i wore often pre-ED… only to find that all of them were extremely EXTREMELY tight. so tight as in, i am definitely no longer that size and could barely breathe. 

i have since been down a complete mental spiral. i knew i gained a lot of weight, but i had managed to reduce any negative emotions induced by it by covering my mirror, avoiding the scale, etc. this only made me confront the facts that i had been avoiding for so long, and i am in just complete utter disbelief and anger at myself for… physically recovering. 

i was wondering if anyone might have any advice, or feel comfortable sharing their own similar experiences? the weight gain has, so far, been the most excruciating part of recovery and i want to scream and cry and die all at the same time."
Is it okay if i purge once a day?,‼️TW: FOR VOMIT‼️ Will it still mess up my body if i just purge once a day?? Its not that much though maybe the amount that you have when your car sick. I also got some chest pains after is that normal
Fashion post-anorexia discussion,"I love fashion but due to anorexia I have found myself collecting clothes that I would like to wear, but not feeling like I ""can"" wear it until I'm ""skinny enough"". I am in recovery and I still feel this way. I recently got rid of a lot of my clothes that I never touched even though they were pretty, because I won't wear them. 

I've finally decided to start trying to make a style out of what I feel safe and comfortable in, and I am basically looking for reassurance that it's okay. I thought recovery would look like accepting my body and wearing the mini skirt and fitted top or whatever, but I am only comfortable in loose clothing. I am now shopping for things like long and flowy clothes that have a romantic style so I can keep wearing loose and oversized clothing, but make it prettier to match my style preferences. 

What is your style and relationship to fashion like in recovery? Have you been able to overcome the burden and fear around getting dressed and wear anything you like? What kind of garments do you prefer? Thanks for your input."
Hair recovery.,One of my symptoms of my Ana was hair falling out. Ever since a teen I always wanted to get a perm because I wanted my curly hair back (when I was a baby I had curly hair but after I had to shave my head for a surgery it didn’t grow back) but didn’t cause my mom said it was a bad idea cause of the hair loss. I been recovered for 5 years and have my own money now and I’ve  thinking about getting one. Tho my hair doesn’t fall out that much anymore s hould I still not risk it or would I be ok?
Got my period back?,"I’m so confused… Ive been spending the weekend with a friend, and noticed a bit of blood on the toilet paper when i wiped. I repeatedly checked a few times to make sure it was a cut from shaving or something unrelated, but it clearly was coming from yk where. so she lent me a pad and when i woke up the morning, nothing. Completely white, now i’m unsure if i actually started it and it’s just really light, or if i didn’t. I’m so scared that i didn’t because we had such an emotional moment last night and am terrified to tell her it wasn’t my period (if that’s the case)

So, my question is: Is it normal to have an extremely light period when recovering from anorexia/bulimia/amenorrhea?

Thanks everyone and i hope you’re all doing well and pushing through xx"
will this problems go away once I actually recovery? Could depression be caused by undereating?Will I be MYSELF AGAIN?,"I've been restricting for a couple of months. Now I'm a like a skelton (idk but I think I'm underweight, but it doesn't make me feel good) and I don't know if I'm depressed or not.I'm 14-15. I used to really enjoy food, ACTUALLY BE A CHILDISH PERSON, WITH A LOT OF ENERGY AND VERY OPTIMISTIC.Now I don't recognize myself anymore. yes, I know that still I'm not eating enough to nourish my poor body, but can this be the cause why I'm feeling so NUMB? Like, I can't feel hapiness, don't enjoy my old hobbies, lost interest in a lot of things, nothing bothers me to make friends anymore. I can't feel anything.For the first time I don't care about my future.I am sad because I was really happy and wanted to improve myself every day (like a child) before. I used to work hard for school, to have the best grades; now I feel like a shadow.Can undereating be the cause? Is my undernourshed body depressed? Eating more would make better?"
Purging relapse,"Today I had a relapse, it's weird because I was almost one year clean, I wasn't even triggered by my weight, (I have gained back a lot since recovery) I just had a lot of anxiety, a burning inside and I felt like the only way to stop the burning would be purging, it worked however now I feel really guilty because I want to do it again."
water weight,i just drank a bottle of water and i gained im scafed its tripping me out
i had a donut after working out,"and thats ok. eating sweets does not cancel out the effectiveness of your workout :) just a friendly reminder that ur allowed to have balance in life, even if your ed says you cant."
Atypical anorexia feeling entirely alone,"I was diagnosed this year with atypical anorexia when I went away to residential for su*cidal ideation. Turns out my body image, frequent periods of barely eating or not eating at all, and attitudes about food and weight inform pretty much everything I do..ever. I restricted pretty much my entire residential stay because I fear eating around others unless I’m tucked away somewhere in a dark restaurant. My clinical team there wanted me to stay longer to address ED but insurance was like nope! I’ve gotten to a point where I fear leaving my apartment because I don’t want others to see or perceive me. I hate the way I look from my hair to my feet. I am in a larger body. When I do go in public, I kinda dissociate like I’m a floating head or something with no body. Sometimes I wish I was faceless, maybe invisible but seen for my career, which is the only thing I feel gives me value. It is hard for me to shower because I don’t like being aware of my body. I have a hard time brushing my teeth because I don’t like looking in the mirror. I have entirely pulled away from my partner sexually. My parents reinforce my thoughts and behaviors and both my sisters are very slim so I don’t have family to turn to. My partner eats the same way I do, which is challenging because I only feel comfortable if I eat at the same time as her and in a similar amount. She is smaller than me and far more attractive. I just hate what I have become and I fear going through life always hating every piece of me. I am seeing an ED and trauma therapist as well as a dietician. I feel like I’m letting my dietician down because I don’t think I can do it. I want recovery SO bad, but most of me doesn’t want to change. She said today I eat less than most restrictive diets, yet here I am. I’m afraid of doctors due to past judgments. I just don’t want to be me. Life is so beautiful and full of opportunity that just doesn’t feel accessible to me."
My partner is having issues and I want some advice?,"Good afternoon,

My partner has recovered anorexia/ bulimia but do to some recent comments from a coworker and stress she is slipping back into some habits.

I'm trying to be as gentle as I can, but I'm still very new to supporting someone through these specific issues. I don't want to overstep or overwhelm them and end up hurting them in my efforts to help.

I am in charge of the cooking most of the time and I try to keep it lean and healthy...but should I pay attention to more veggies at this time. Preferred lighter foods? More small snacks that are easy to grab? Granola?

Any advice would be welcome, I will also answer questions ( but only what I feel would be okay to share) 

Thank you in advanced."
Nervous about eating at restaurant later,"I’m seeing my Dad for dinner later on and we’re going out to some restaurant that is yet to be determined. I’m really really nervous about doing this because I’ve always had this rule that if I’m going out to eat I have to full on restrict the whole day in preparation and skip eating so I can “save” calories for later on. Restaurant food has always been tricky for me because of unknown calories and dinner is also the hardest meal of the day for me to eat because it feels like a waste of calories in a way, like I’m not putting the energy towards anything useful since I’ve already got home from work by that time and don’t do much in my evenings generally. I’ve been in recovery for about 2 and a half months and have weight restored but the fear of gaining more weight still hangs over me constantly. Early on in developing my ED I read a lot of threads on certain diet and weight loss subs on here and a lot of people on there would talk about engaging in the exact behaviours I later would end up adopting (ie: skipping meals if they’re going out at night or using the gym to compensate either before or after) and praising each other as being disciplined, and that attitude has really stuck with me for a long time and it’s been so so so difficult to try and unlearn since my ED can justify saving calories as something normal people do BECAUSE of discussion threads like that. 

This dinner was meant to happen two weeks ago but I cancelled on my Dad back then because I got freaked out and panicked since I hadn’t followed the rules and had eaten breakfast and lunch instead of skipping. I’ve already eaten a breakfast of oatmeal and yoghurt, a cookie as a snack and 4 mini brioche buns for lunch today and am so nervous about later on because I’m scared I’m going to overeat and gain weight. But I can’t cancel on my Dad again and need to challenge myself if I’m gonna make any real progress in recovery.

I hate making posts like these but I need some support and reassurance that I’m not doing something morally wrong by going out to dinner tonight"
Recovery issues with eating patterns and selection,"I need some advice.  I am in recovery,  or at least trying for about a month now. I am adding calorie dense foods to my diet, but I literally eat the same things everyday. Its like I don't really want to, I know I need to be normal, but when it comes to meal time I just go into repeat mode. I can list exactly what I eat at what time I eat it.  
1) 6:30 am   1 sweet potato with 1 tbsp peanut butter on it, 6 grapes, 6 oz soy milk.
2) 1:00 pm  1/2 cucumber, 6 squares watermelon, 2 thin slices deli meat, 4 pretzels, 3 walnuts
3) 8:00 pm. 1/2 zucchini, 5 cauliflower florets, 1/2 carrot, 1 slice of tofu or 1 egg (grilled in a pan of water), 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/4 tortilla with butter and salt
4)  12:00 am. 1 avocado, 5 dates with peanut butter, 1 1/2 cups air popped popcorn, 8 walnuts


I am actually thinking that I'm making myself sick, so much that I feel like I'm so hungry, yet what I'm repeatedly eating makes me nauseous just thing about it. Also, since I've been doing this, my whole body hurts so bad, feels like my muscles have a sunburn and my digestion is not working at all. I feel so bloared and uncomfortable,  I feel as if I'm just storing everything and its also causing edema a bit.  I'm just so tired of this, mentally I'm losing my mind, its scary when you seriously don't want to be here anymore because of this horrible groundhog day scenario  that won't stop.  Please, I desperately need help, thank you."
So tired of feeling weak,"At the moment, I don’t think there’s been a point in my life where I’ve felt more physically and emotionally weak. I do not suffer from any type of body dysmorphia but developed anorexia due to health issues. I’m so frustrated with not being able to just care for myself and carry out normal tasks due to weakness, I just feel awful 24/7"
"Relapse, getting back on track and overshoot","As of this morning I’m trying to get back on track after a couple weeks of relapse. Before the relapse I was less than 5 pounds off from what I believe is my set point weight. Now I’ve lost x pounds in the last few weeks. But I’m afraid starting at a higher weight this time will cause a dramatic overshoot, that might’ve not happened if I hadn’t relapsed?"
Scared after school fest,I'm very scared after what I did on school. I ate a lot and I wonder if it made sense. Help needed
Food doesn't taste that good anymore,When food will taste good again in recovery?
Vennnnnt,"Just anyone else?


I’ve been physically sick every time I eat, I bloat like a dead beached whale, it’s so damn painful. Feeling like throwing up but never getting their for any relief. 

I’m either running to the looo cause I can’t hold it or I’m not going for days on end and just ugh that pain. 

I miss my ED - I (it) would be thriving on not being able to eat and slowly loosing weight. 

But now I’m just pissed, I’m pretty much recovered, I want eat and taste different stuff, but now even my “safe foods” fuck me physically- it’s not in my head I know that - I kinda wish it was and then I could address it, fix it and get the fuck over it. 

But no, my stomach lining is inflamed like a bitch and doctors don’t know why and there’s not much meds that I haven’t tried or even have helped. 

I want to eat all the sweets I missed out of for decades, I want to try weird different foods from other cultures, I love coffee and want to have milk with them again like I did before my ED.

For now I eat what I can when I can, and I enjoy with our guilt these days vs the ‘good old’ days. 

But now - 

Here I am, either in pain from eating but I don’t have the brain fog which is awesome. Or I don’t eat, physically feel ok, but by the day goes on I’m drained, I can’t concentrate, I’m irritated easily and so damn tired. 

My ED would love the above shit and we would be running on a god damn high….. I miss that high - it just feels like it would be easier to deal with this physical shit if I had my ED

But I know it would only make shit worse at the same time. 

Fuck logic. Blarg

Thanks for reading."
Difficult body image day - 4 months in,"Hi, like the title says I’m four months into recovery and having a hard body image day. 
My body restored far quicker than I expected and I think it’s still gaining weight. I’m fixated on how many sizes I’ve increased, and as I’m writing this I realize I’ve been minorly restricting for about a month now. 
Recovery is hard. 
I did an exercise to help with my body image which was listing 5 things my body does for me:
1. It lets me live
2. It lets me feel joy, love, pleasure, excitement, adventure
3. It lets me connect with other humans and my pets
4. It lets me release emotions through dance
5. It lets me intertwine with beauty via fashion, drawing, being in nature
It’s nice to put this out there in a community that I know gets it, so thank you. 

I also ordered dinner cuz opposite action and I know eating helps me feel better ❤️‍🩹"
Dips and spreads,"Does anybody else find themselves eating spreads and dips by the spoonful? I really love chocolate spreads and hummus and stuff like that, but I find myself craving it and literally just eat it by the spoonful which makes me end up feeling so guilty. 

Has this happened to anybody else? Is there a way to stop craving it like that, or do I just need to honor that craving for it to go away?"
Quitting Smoking after Treatment,"I'm nervous to ask this, so please ask me to remove this post if it's triggering an any way and I happily will. I went into recovery October of 2019. I somehow stuck it out through the pandemic and even managed to gain weight and be *gasp* happy about it. I'm so proud of how far I've come and I honestly LOVE that my thighs touch and even have cellulite and jiggle now, it's been quite the journey, but I'm in a good place. Cue quitting smoking roughly ten days ago. I thought it was going well at first and then noticed I was slipping pretty severely in behaviors. I expected a bit of weight gain, but have found myself with the opposite problem, unfortunately. This is hugely triggering and concerning as you'd imagine. I'm feeling run down, have a headache, but also that familiar numb hum that accompanied behaviors and it terrifies me that I've gotten to that point. Has anyone else been through this? My behaviors were always linked directly to my anxiety, so I guess that makes sense on some level, but this is *not* what I was expecting or signed up for."
Can't lose weight?,I gained too much weight in recovery due to bingeing and now I can't seem to lose weight anymore? I've tried HIIT and running but the scale is only going up. I know it's bad but I started cutting out certaim foods again.. but still I can't lose one pound. What can I do?
Return to running..,"A few wks ago I started light jogging again after a few yrs break from any form of cardiovascular exercise (except walking).. Now I've found myself back into the pressure mindset of increasing my pace and mileage and having to do the same routine daily. I do enjoy being outside and working on my cardio/heart health (plus it keeps me out of the gym), but how do others ease off the rule(s) that a certain number of hours/miles is required every single day? Exercise is never looked down upon in our society, so it's hard to go moderate or take a break even if for a day. I've had AN since my teens and am almost 50yrs old now. Wish I could say it gets easier with age, but really it just keeps morphing into different forms of illness."
Night eating,"I have been kind of relapsing in my recovery. I am like 3 months into it and have gained quite a bit of weight. I began to pull back and slowly restrict. The thing is my body fought back and even though I was kind of restricting I would eat a lot at night, mainly safe foods but maintained my weight. Now I feel like I failed at recovery because mentally I want to fall back into bad restrictive habits, I hate how I look, I feel like I gained weight in vain and I am in no way more free now. What do I do please help"
Something odd I still do,"Been recovering on and off for over a year and been doing quite well. At set point body weight and ED behaviours are disappearing as time goes on. But something was pointed out to me recently that I didn't realise I did, but I was facetiming my boyfriend and I bent down to get something from the floor. He laughed and said ""why are you moving like that?"" , and basically I realised rather than just bending over normally, I unconsciously arch my shoulder blades and stretch my arms out far instead of bending a reasonable distance to reach the object. I used to do this in the mirror bc it made my ribs look prominent, but I never realised I do this in everyday life. I started to notice it every time after that. Its so weird, bc I don't feel really any much better for doing it, I just do it out of habit still. I do it in baggy clothes etc so it's not to show off my body to anyone. its made me wonder what other thins do I do from my ED that I'm unaware of? either way, recover guys, bc people will notice some proper weird stuff about u and say u move like a creep!"
Recovery and hunger feeling,It is normal that in recovery stage of AN I still don't feel normal hunger in stomach but somehow in throat and still eat? Am I doing things right?
12 weeks without weighing myself!!,Today marks 12 weeks since I last weighed myself which is the longest I’ve gone since pre ED😮 I still get the urge every now and again but I’m so much happier without knowing. For anyone considering to try to stop weighing themselves I highly recommend!!
"I’m nervous, I have to fast for a blood test but my left hand is tingling…","So, this month I chose to recover and this tingling started when I was sick and it comes back and goes away constantly. I’m sure is nerve damage or some vitamin deficiency. The blood test will make sure everything is in place and will give me more answers.

Everything went according to my meal plan today but this tingling is somehow worse than ever today. I’m so scared this fasting period may worsen it even more. I hate that I’m being forced into this old habit of mine I want to get away from. I’m nervous!! Any big nutritious meal ideas before this fasting period begins? Thank you in advance"
Spending money on food,"I am cheap in general and food is no exception. I try to buy the cheapest food I possibly can, which is fine when it’s some stuff like bread, but whenever I want something like ice cream I have a really hard time justifying buying it. I tend to be craving ice cream all the time right now and I feel like it’s an unnecessary purchase because it’s expensive. I’m worried that if I start eating it now, I will want it all the time and and I won’t be able to afford that once I’m on my own and out of college.

I don’t know if anyone has experienced this or if you have any thoughts or suggestions, but please let me know."
Why is weight loss my solution to everything?,"Does anyone else feel the same way? If someone is slightly rule to me, my mind always goes back to losing more and more. It just seems like any negative feeling accumulated by anything just sets me off on the weight anxiety spiral. 

It’s almost as if I believe that if I just lose enough then I’ll finally no issues and so the only reason I still am is just because I’m not skinny enough.

That’s not true, I know, but I just can’t shake it. Does anyone else relate?"
inpatient and feelings of guilt,"tw calories!!


so Friday  I got sent 2½ hours away to a children's hospital because they are very concerned (ed team that I just had my first appointment with on friday) that if I start recovery on my own at home I might get refeeding syndrome so they are having my intake upped slowly at a ed inpatient.  it's been very hard, yesterday I had a breakdown because im like ""how many calories are in this"" ""I'm gonna come out here fat"" etc, and I was able to finish all 3 meals yesterday but I almost had to get a half replacement, which today for breakfast I had too. I can't stop thinking about how much weight I've probably gained, I can't stop estimating the calories in my head, my body is so physically tired and I'm taking multiple naps a day, I feel so guilty. I can't stop thinking about my body, and I feel like when I get home I'll relapse. I'm just so scared that I'm gonna come out of here with an extra 20 pounds on my body. I also don't know how many calories I'm being fed currently but from what i eat it dosent seem like enough food sometimes? but also my blood work and stuff are fine so that might be why also, they need to do it slowly too. also seeing the other patients not eat is kinda triggering?"
Hypoglycaemia in recovery,"I’ve been eating according to my clinics meal plan for about 5-6 months now. Had my ups and downs of course but I’ve been pretty consistent. I eat 6 times a day, 3 meals and 3 snacks. 

I’m pretty much weight restored but I still struggle with what I suspect is hypoglycaemia? My body feels weak and “spaghetti” and my hands shake. Goes away after eating. This happens every single day, always in early morning and NEVER more than 2 hours after eating breakfast. Sometimes happens at other times throughout the day if I space out my meals to much but the “2 hours after breakfast”-thing is super consistent. 

Has anyone else experienced the same thing, and wheeeen does it go away??? It’s a trigger for me because I’m scared my body will take over and I’ll eat *everything* to get my blood sugar up and at the same time my ED brain is enjoying it because experiencing physical symptoms makes me feel “sick enough”🙃"
Relapse after doing amazing,"Relapse after doing amazing

  I fucked up so bad I relapsed after weeks of doing amazing. I was eating normally again, not too much and not too little, and actually feeling GOOD about it. Then I woke up at 3:00 in the afternoon today and decided to not eat the whole day bc it was too late. My mom could see I was extremely upset and didn't force me. I'm scared il get extreme hunger tomorrow especially since I haven't had it in so long what if I binge again ugh"
saw some old photos from when i was sick,ik it's probably not good for me but i look sometimes. it used to make me sick bc i don't look like that anymore. this time it just made me sad. i never want to be back there again. i wasn't smiling in any of them. i remember how cold and empty i was. there was nothing left. get better guys. there's a whole life waiting for you.
Having trouble with breakfast,"I'm still in the middle of the recovery process and trying to gain weight, but my biggest obstacle is being hungry enough to eat in the morning. I want to get back to a healthy body and this part is frustrating me most.

Don’t know what to do,"20yo male, in college and I feel like I just hit a realization that makes me want to completely “relapse”. I say that in quotes because I never went through a proper recovery, I was diagnosed and in therapy but no proper treatment or anything I just kind of gave up restricting and started eating whenever and whatever I wanted and as a result I’ve ballooned up and become “skinny fat”. I guess I’m like a fake anorexic in that regard. Mentally I’d say I’m just as worse as ever and recently I’ve been receiving comments and seeing pictures that show that I am in really bad shape and I’ve been very unsure about what to do about that. Ive been speaking to a dietitian who is helping me eat to restore my metabolism and hunger cues but it’s really hard since all I want to do is lose weight. I’m not even sure if it’s working and I’m scared all it’s going to do is add more body fat. I recognize that my goals are still very disordered as I’m doing this while also going to the gym so I can build muscle and then cut to gain the body I’ve always hoped for. But I just feel so awful, I’ve kind of accepted that I’m ugly and not wanted any more (before there was a sense of delusion or security that told me that I was actually good looking and not ugly). But now after seeing recent pictures and getting input from others I see that I’m in really bad shape. I don’t know what to do, all I want to do is redirect and disregard what the dietitian ian is saying  but I’m so scared to do that again. I don’t want to relapse but at the same time I want my skinny and attractive body back. I don’t know what to do, I feel worse and more insecure and self hateful than ever."
Appetite loss?,"I've been in all in recovery and now I've dealt w intense extreme mental hunger for 3 months, but have now been dealing w hunger nd appetite loss. due to this ik I'm not getting in the amount of calories that I actually need to heal my body. what should I do? it's been like this for like a week now, and I think the calories im eating are too low but I jus suddenly lost my hunger and appetite.I jus can't physically eat more anymore."
Am I overreacting,I’ve been following an eating plan for about a week and got worried about refeeding syndrome and took a single multivitamin (nothing above 100% daily intake besides 200% Vitamin D) and now im worried about having too many vitamins in me and potential symptoms of vitamin A or any other vitamin overdose. Should I be worried? Its just a single multivitamin but I’m scared it’ll have effects since im following an eating plan.
weight restored but still obsessive over what i eat,"i have always felt like i am eating too much. i am weight restored and i still think i eat too much. i stopped a meal plan as soon as i reached the weight that the doctors wanted me to me and just started ""eating intuitively"" but i was so bad at that. i hate eating intuitively because i dont trust my intuition. i overthink my hunger and fullness cues a lot. i snack about 3 or more times a day, plus 3 meals. i feel very insecure abt how often i eat, even tho i eat pretty healthy i think for the most part. and im afraid if i keep eating how i eat i will continue gaining weight. i already am noticing some weight gain. i am so stressed and anxious, i feel like i can never get it ""right"" and just eat normally. i wish i cld just eat less. im going back on my meal plan so i dont have to think abt it so much but idk if it will work. i dont wanna be like this forever :("
tips for saggy/extra skin?,"i’m 19 and lost  very rapidly as i was obese, resulting in lose skin on my butt that droops and folds with extra skin, as well as folds on my inner thigh (i think i held a lot of weight in my thighs/buttock). i also have some loose skin at the bottom of belly and on my arms, however it’s not so bad.
i’ve been in recovery for about five months now and i do light exercises every few days (10 minute butt/ab type stuff on youtube) and i get around 5k steps everyday. since i’m recovering, i eat enough ish. i take biotin supplements.
what can i do to tighten my skin? there’s nothing wrong with it of course, all bodies are beautiful and natural but once again i’m only 19 and it’s embarrassing. it feels like a mark this stupid disease has left. exercise/recovery has helped somewhat but i really need some advice. 
anything helps. thank you!"
"eating isn’t the hard part, it’s NOT eating that’s impossible",
Recovered but always sick now,"I was very malnourished for a good 5 years (senior year of highschool -> throughout college -> 1 year of working) but i’m finally on a slow track to eating regularly.

I noticed ever since i graduated from college, i’m ALWAYS sick. To the point where i’m sick with a cold/flu AT LEAST twice a month sometimes 4 times a month. This past year so far i’ve been sick 21 times and counting. 6 times with covid 😭 i know it’s actually terrible. It’s so bad my coworkers think i’m slacking because i always need to take sick days. 

In august I was sick 3 times with 1 cold after another. I go from sore throat -> fever -> healing/cough -> sore throat again while coughing phlegm (new cold). I essentially have 2 colds at a time now

I’m so tired of getting a sore throat, fever and the whole thing. I was wondering if anyone else suffers low immunity now that they’re recovered and started recovering?

Has anyone RECOVERED from low immunity after anorexia? I really want to fix my body and immune system. Any tips are appreciated!"
What signifies that I am safe to exercise?,"Hi all, wondering if I’m safe to go for walks/runs or lift anything? Doing poorly in recovery and would like to go outside before it gets cold. Any signfiers i can or cant? I know weights arent allowed here but is it depended on weight or how much ive eaten/strength?"
Relapse,"Hey y’all, I’ve been in recovery for about a year and a half. I used to be very relapse prone but I’ve generally gotten way better about it, thanks be to God. Occasionally I’ll backslide a bit but it’s been probably since March since I’ve done something like this. I’ve been under eating for about two weeks. I’ve been exercising a bit more (very light resistance training 2-3 times per week and about 8000 avg steps a day walking). I had an eating plan that was working and I just dropped it to go by feel. Well I wake up last night, heart racing, starving, anxious, the whole fucking bit. I dunno I guess I just needed to say this out loud. Any support, encouragement, or anyone who can give some reassurance about my symptoms last night would be welcomed and much appreciated. This shit sucks and I don’t want to do it to myself anymore."
Meals out,"Eating out scares me. I avoided it for years and I’ve just recently began doing it as of like three months ago. It’s still hard, but recently I have found myself wanting to go out to eat all the time. I have meals at home, but I just find myself wanting to go out. It makes me feel like I’m faking anorexia but I know it should be a good sign in recovery. Has anybody else experienced something similar? Is it just because I didn’t do it for so long my body wants it, kind of like how you crave energy dense food a lot in early recovery?"
need help,i just finished a 3 month intense outpatient program. am about a month afterwards and working w an outpatient team. but it’s just too hard. i don’t want to do it anymore. i’ve gained so much weight im almost overweight. my body is out of shape and feels awful. im not allowed to work out other than yoga or walks and i feel like im going crazy. im not allowed to depart from the 3 meals/3 snacks and the 2 items per snack. i really feel like i can’t do it anymore. my team just keeps telling me to “be strong” but all my strength is gone. all i think about is relapse. isn’t there any other way to recover? isn’t there something i can do?
Unexplained rapid weight gain,"

Hi I'm 15F and I've noticed the weight gain for 2 weeks now. Fyi I've been anorexia recovery for almost a year now and I'm at a healthy weight,, however I haven't gotten my period back so I'm still under supervision. I got approved to resume physical activity including exercise. I do cardio for ~1 hour for 5 days a week, and weight lift twice a week. I'm currently consuming up around 2390 kcals a day and I've been keeping my diet the same for almost 3months. My doctor asked me to weigh myself regularly so to track any weight gain/loss. So on 23rd August, I weighed 44.6kg, before breakfast and after going to the bathroom. Just after 3 days I weighed myself again and I'm at 46.8kg, with empty stomach and after going to the bathroom. Its a total 2kg weight gain. I didn't think it was water retention because I don't see any swelling. But I thought maybe it's just hormones causing it so I didn't think much of it and moved on. After 2 weeks, which is today, I weighed 47.8kg with an empty stomach. This is so confusing because before the unexplained weight gain, I gain weight pretty slowly and even maintain my weight with my 2390kcal diet. I suspect I've been experiencing hypermetabolism in the time I didn't weight gain and after my metabolism went back normal I packed on a lot of weight  of the extra calories, I feel very ashamed of this and I don't know what to do. Does anyone know what could be happening? Is it really fat gain?"
Health Anxiety,"Hi, I just joined this page and wanted to share some things and have a few questions. I developed anorexia about 2 years ago. (not sure if i’m allowed to put numbers so i won’t in case of any triggers) I got pretty low and I started to develop major health anxiety. I gained weight since my lowest and i’m in the healthy range right now. But this has spiked my anxiety so bad that i feel like every feeling i’ve felt since i was at my lowest, that i was going to die. If i’m healthy weight now is it likely i’m okay? I am in no way completely recovered and I definitely have a long way to go. Another question is when would i be able to start exercising? I’m just worried something will happen to me. Recovery is very hard and I can’t even look at myself in the mirror even tho everyone says there’s no major difference, I’d like to exercise to at least feel better within myself. Sorry this post is all over the place."
All in made me miserable,After going all in all I can think about is food and every task in my life has been pushed away because I constantly need to eat. I feel like I’ve lost focus in my life. My acne started popping up I look terrible and I seem to just not care. I feel like I am on the road to obesity too. Everything is a mess. Please tell me if anyone went through this or have tips to start getting back up. Feels like I’m not in recovery but rather just have let myself go.
worries about recovery,"tw talking about weight 

I am starting recovery from anorexia through an ed team tomorrow, dietitian, therapist, etc.
one of my top worries is what if I develop BED? binge eating? or extreme hunger? (which ik will probably happen). what if I get a new high weight? I've always been underweight or healthy weight my whole life, but what if I become one of those people that had anorexia but developed binge eating disorder? I am so scared for the weight gain. I'm kinda dreading recovery now, I'm not as excited anymore."
Looks degraded,"I've had Anorexia for 7 years and now I'm at a healthy weight again (for 4 years) but I look completely different. My face looks so sick.I am very pale/yellowish and my eyes look lifeless. Also my body doesn't look at alll like it did before. I used to have a waist, butt and boobs and now I don't but I have a lot of fat on my stomach waist and thighs. My arms are very skinny though. I look so strange like out of proportion ? I thought this would be an initial phase but it's been like this for years. Has anorexia destroyed my looks for good?"
Im crying over food now,"‼️TW: VENT???‼️Before I relapsed i never realized why someone would cry other their food, now i just cannot stand the sight of someone eating or making food or just thinking about it and i will try to avoid it as much as i can, i just want to scream and cry every time i go to lunch at school. i dont know how i could ever explain it. if someone could explain that would be good. No one know im suffering from it, but i know my friends are suspecting because i go through periods of not eating sometimes, i heard my friend tell someone i had anorexia which i never told her i did. They also try to shove food in my mouth."
Being unattractive is stunting my recovery,"I'm a very unattractive person and it's stunting my recovery. Every time I think about facial dysmorphia I feel like I have to make up for it by being as skinny as possible. Anyone else have any idea what to do when recovery has failed multiple times due to this? I've been through a partial hospitalization program and many different counselors that have done absolutely nothing to help and I feel like giving in every single day. I'm wondering if it's really that wrong to consider facial cosmetic surgery if it means I can accept myself more, but I'm in highschool and my parents are middle class and might not be able to afford it unless it's necessary. Anything helps, thank you."
swimming in clothes,"Over the oast few years I have bought multiple pairs of high end bathing suits in the hope that I'd come to feel comfortable in these beautiful pieces. I never did though. I wenf into the water for the first time in years yesterday covered by running shorts and a tshirt. Me and my partner where tje only ones in the area so it felt safe.
I wonder if I will ever feel comfortable enough with myself to not feel the need to constantly cover up, it's been this way for half my life and I truly hate it."
Regret going all-in instead of following a meal plan?,"Does anyone here regret that they went all-in/consistently honored their EH vs following a more structured meal plan? I just ate a massive amount of eggs/cheese/vegetables + four (!) chocolate croissants + a slice of biscuit cake for breakfast and was still hungry afterwards...I feel like my satiety cues are all over the place and I'm worried I will become habituated to this way of eating and never be able to stop....plus the only thing that happens if I don't honor my EH is mental discomfort....I'm trying to trust my body but it is really hard to know whether to follow the plan or to just ""pop off"" at any moment my EH roars its head...."
Overexercising and burn out,"Hi everybody, it's been a really long time since i've posted on here, but i've sort of relapsed I guess you could say, but throughout my entire recovery I've almost always done a workout every single day, I said I didn't need a rest day and that my body was just different. But lately, even though I have a lot of energy, I can't bring myself to do a poper workout, I'm 14 for reference, and yesterday I did a running club but it's never a good workout and today even though I had enough energy, I had some wifi problems and it was very hot outside, I ended up doing a weights workout, Which I never do, I've always done only cardio, and I just feel so lazy, I've been taking too many breaks and I don't know I feel confused and I just want to leave, or stop, or start, I don't even know, cause I'm also back at school now and I'm sitting down a lot... I don't even know I just know I feel upset and disappointed. Does anybody have any tips or words of support. "
Meal plan comparison,"Possible TW. 
Can someone please share meal plan they got prescribed from registered dietician? I just got one and would like to compare out of curiosity. And it would motivate me more I think. If here is not allowed, then DM me if you are okay with that. Thx all!"
3 years recovered - went from underweight to obese,"It’s been three years since my lowest in anorexia, and today I now find myself almost a hundred pounds heavier. Going from underweight to obese, and acknowledging it is crazy. I’ve always had severe body dysmorphia, and never truly knowing what I look like, suddenly seeing my doctor's report on BMI truly shocked me. I’ve always felt like I had rolls and a massive body, but now it’s confirmed that I do. It’s not having a “womanly body” or being heavy-set, im legitimately obese. I realize I need help in the opposite direction, but I don’t know how to do so without reverting into old habits, especially considering I abused both dieting and exercise when I was young and damaged my body permanently in more ways than one. I’m scared to start the journey because losing weight reminds me of my mindset when I was a teenager. I don’t want to hate myself again, but I also don’t want to deal with the health risks that come with obesity. Any support or advice would be appreciated."
How do you feel when you look at pictures of yourself before AN?,I looked at pictures of myself pre relapse yesterday and I felt disgusted. I thought it would make me realize I was beautiful and that I didn’t need to lose weight in the end. But I just feel even worse about myself now and I want to hide. I think I looked fat and ugly and I acted awkward. I can never recover if it means looking and being the way I used to.
Jus me?,"I feel like food isn't jus food anymore. It has to be in a category marked as healthy or unhealthy. And every food now has a number on it. Even tho I'm all in recovery, those numbers and categories are still there existing and popping up in your brain every time you eat something. And the thing is this is normal. Or at least I feel like it, or everyone in society has immensely embraced it."
Sex drive/libido back,"So I have been actively trying to recover for almost 11 weeks, been experiencing extreme hunger for almost 7 weeks and I am almost at the weight I was before I fell into my ED (I only lost 10-11 pounds and restricted for less than 12 weeks so not a massive amount needed to gain) and have felt signs of my period wanting to return. Recently I’ve felt my sex drive come back in FULL force, I feel like a teenager! Is this a good sign things are starting to regulate again? I’m feeling pretty good other than the extreme hunger driving me mad."
Recent wins,"Hello, last week I decided I would try to commit to recovery and I just wanted to list some recent wins.
- ate all my lunch that my mom packed for me at work
- I didn’t weigh myself last week
- I drank a glass of chocolate milk instead of water with breakfast 
- I challenged biscoff a few times
I know it isn’t much but I’m trying."
Refeeding Malabsorption?,"I’ve started refeeding and have been experiencing trips to the bathroom which feel like diarrhea. My pooping feels very runny and always looks pale and more like a collection of bits and pieces of yellow, green bits and fluffy stool. Type 6 on the bristol stool scale. I can see part of the stem of the spinach i ate and stuff as well. 
Are these gi issues normal? will they go away? Im worried about having really bad gi issues or malabsorption"
Do I have to stop counting c@ls to recover?,"I’m pretty sure that I know the answer to this question, just need to hear the answer straight out. Do I have to stop counting calories to recover? I’m working my way twords eating at maintenance but I’m scared that if I get there and stop tracking then I’ll overeat"
class assignment involves tracking food for a whole week. what do i do?,"i’m a college student and i was looking ahead at all my assignments for the semester. in my nutrition class, theres an assignment that requires me to track all nutrition and calorie information of what i eat and drink for a full week. obviously this is not a good idea for me since i’m just starting to recover, and i’m not supposed to be paying attention to calories. another option is to track someone else’s food intake but i know that even if i do that, i’ll still compare myself to them and that will trigger me. should i suck it up and track someone else’s calories or should i talk to my professor about it?"
Suddenly super sensitive to caffeine??,"I experienced extreme heavy restriction for the past 4-5 months and began slowly increasing my intake over the past few weeks. Still mostly at maintenance. 

I had a scare the other night after drinking a few sips of a red bull about 3 hours before going to bed. I hadn't slept for 2 days so I was ready to go right to sleep, but I didn't fall asleep until 7:30am and had a full-blown anxiety /panic attack that lasted about 6 hours. I almost called 911 as my heart rate reached the high 140's, and had to have my mom read to me on the phone all night like a child (I'm 20). 2 days have passed now and I had a few sips of coffee this morning. About 2 hours later, I had the same type of anxiety/panic attack and luckily it went away after only an hour or so. Is this a normal part of recovery? Or did anyone else become intolerant to caffeine after months of heavy restriction? "
scared to recover,"I start recovery on friday with an ed team (dietitian, therapist, etc) and I am excited to get my life back kinda but at the same time, I am so scared. it's gonna be so hard to start recovery especially since I'll probably get extreme hunger (I've had it before) and that is one of the most mentally exhausting things ever. I thought about trying to maybe start a couple days early but I don't think I can do it on my own, plus like I said previously - extreme hunger and binging. I don't know what to expect and I'm just so scared to recover and changes with my body. it's also gonna be werid to adjust to intuitive eating"
"Hello, I am new to this","I have met a girl online and didn\`t know about her condition before. After a few weeks chatting online we met the first time. She is wonderful, beautiful and so loving. We have been together now for almost one year. I belive her main problems are rooted at work, with a very mean boss. I could convince her to switch departments and supported her emotionally as good as I can. 

When she visits me I cook whatever she desires and I am really happy when she eats more than one portion. I call her every day when she is not with me and ask her what she had that day, normally she dosen\`t eat more than an apple ,sometimes a slice of bread in addition.

Is there anything else I could do?

Am I being to pushy? Am I doing something wrong?

How can I be a better support?"
Help,"now that I am recovering from anorexia and some lapse of binge restrict cycles, I have gained a little bit of weight. When I look at myself in the mirror I notice absolutely every flaw. This might sound triggering but I am trying to lose weight. Yet for some reason my stupid brain panics when I feel fat and I binge every time. I need so advice"
small meal suggestions?,"I’m 26, 97lb, 5’0 

I’ve lived off coffee and takis since college. every time I try to eat a full meal I become nauseous. 
I can’t hold down meat or fish but I did eat some soup and breadsticks last week with no problem. 


Can anyone recommend small meal ideas to help me get my appetite again?"
A phrase that has gotten me through a lot! 💕,"My body can handle whatever food I give it.

Meaning I may eat more than usual one day or I may start eating more every day. I may start drinking milky coffee instead of black coffee, every single time. I may have a meal out, or several meals out, and it may have more oil than what I’m used to or be a large portion, but it doesn’t matter because my body can handle it."
Unhealthy motivation to recover?,"So to start I have been in an eating disorder cycle for years but almost a year ago I fully got stuck in this terrible disorder and in January of this year to March I was in a treatment facility. In the beginning I was still really motivated but now I am back at college and teetering going back to a treatment facility. I noticed how my looks have gone down so much because of the weight loss and although now I like one part of myself more, I hate how every other part is. Is it bad if my motivation would to get liposuction in the coming year? I am 19 and have all the money but I want other opinions if this is good motivation."
EH at Catering/Buffets?,"Does anyone else who is in the process of re-nourishing during AN recovery find themselves especially ""triggered"" or helpless at catered spreads/buffets? I feel like my body just entered a straight up fight-or-flight response while looking at the abundance of food and couldn't stop itself...no doubt this is also because these were also spaces where I allowed myself to eat more during my more restrictive periods....it's as if my body is still preparing for a famine, even though food has been regularly coming in for months now and I've gained a significant amount of weight....I'm trying to trust my body, I know it still wants/I still need to gain weight, and I know that the EH won't stop until I reach my set point ...but it is so hard because I feel absolutely awful (physically and emotionally) after these episodes."
Can anorexia be cause by poor gut microbiome?,Curious about this for people who don’t want to be skinny but can’t eat and when they eat they don’t gain weight or suffer from slow motility/fatigue etc.
Physical and mental recovery timescales as shown in brain scans,"Hello this [summary of research into the brain scans of patients with AN compared with those at various stages of recovery (including those weight-restored for differing amounts of time)](https://reneemcgregor.com/2019/10/ed-and-the-brain/) came up in another post about how long some parts of recovery take e.g. body prioritising fat storage around stomach. I also think it might be useful for understanding why things like extreme hunger can also persist long after weight restoration because even though our body might look on the surface the same as it did pre-ED, our brains and no doubt other organs are undergoing repair. Producing hormones required for healthy mental and physical function also requires energy.

So I thought it would be useful to share as a standalone post as I've found it really helpful when it comes to sitting with uncomfortable body changes and to keep going when I'm feeling frustrated that my brain is lagging behind physical recovery.

Main points:

* Anorexia decreases brain volume but after weight restoration AND nutritional rehabilitation, brain volume returns to normal. Length of recovery to normal brain volume in that particular study ranged from 29 to 40 months.
* Patients can recover gray matter in the brain but still exhibit lower verbal ability, cognitive efficiency, maths and reading, and verbal recall IF regular menses have not resumed. The suggestion is that the brain needs to restore volume but it also needs the sex hormones back online to work as oestrogen increases blood flow in the brain. This is further evidence that you might weight-restore but you still have further nutritional rehabilitation to do in order to give your body enough energy to make those hormones.
* Another study pointed to the importance of menstrual cycle restoration, as if maintained, it seems to lead to full cognitive function after \*at least\* 6 months. 
* There is not enough research in males or in older populations. I surmise it would be therefore important to have regular blood tests and/or monitor other signs of oestrogen/testosterone coming back to normal levels in those populations."
What’s your experience when your dietitian increases your meal plan?,"I’m really struggling and feel alone in my experience. What have been your experiences when going through meal plan increases?


The social media vibe when someone has a meal plan increase is usually along the lines of “this sucks but I can do it no prob *proceeds to film WIEIAD*” or all positive vibes and rainbows all in. 


But when I get a meal plan increase, like recently my breakfast and lunch portions doubled, it feels impossible. I can manage it at breakfast but I haven’t been able to do my lunch increase and have been skipping it altogether out of residual guilt from eating the increased breakfast. I’m having more negative/ed thoughts as bad as I did when I first started this round of recovery. The thoughts that I need to restrict and fear of food are echoing in my head constantly. 
My dad also died a few weeks ago so that hasn’t helped. 


(Aside note: My increases are to coincide with the plan to wean off of home NG feeds.  The NG feeds have been my safety net of ‘medicalized’ nutrition that I’m completely comfortable having.  But my team wants to wean me off the NG and increase my solid food intake to match what I have been receiving via NG.)"
i don't know anymore,"I was forced into recovery back in February and to be honest hearing all the damaging things that I was doing to myself scared me. Ana put me at risk of heart failure, I lost a lot of weight as well as muscle mass because of a protein deficiency. over the summer I was tired of feeling stuck and I was able to convince myself that I wanted to gain weight and be healthy, but then in August I had a check-up and was weighed in at 15lbs higher than my lowest. Because of that I have lost so much motivation and the food guilt is awful. I still record everything in a fitness tracker and I haven't had my period in almost a year, but part of me feels like I've done enough- my BMI is in the healthy range (then again it never actually wasn't). I'm so tired. I haven't seen my psychiatrist since June (she was kind of useless anyway though tehe) and even if I wanted to start seeing her again I'm genuinely too busy with school. I'm torn between wanting to be healthy (I have no idea if I am or not) and loving myself, but the thing is I didn't love myself during my ed and definitely not now either. I was only ever alright with my body before all of this started and I just wish I could go back. the thing that kills me is that girls at school, not even my super close friends but just sweet girls have told me I look like I could be a model and they make me feel so pretty, even though deep down I feel like a pig wearing lipstick. I'm really sorry if this is triggering I just have no idea what to do. This probably isn't even coherent so I guess it's more of a vent post than anything else. I don't know what I'm trying to say. I don't want to be infertile. I don't want to make my mom cry anymore. but I also want all the guilt and self hatred to go away. I can barely even restrict anymore when I try to, I've gotten so used to trying to gain weight that I can't break my eating habits. every time I open the fridge I tell myself ""I need to get weight so it's ok!!"" but the minute I actually have the food in front of me I want to throw it out. I can see the places where the pounds are going- big surprise it's not to where I hoped it would go and it disgusts me. (if this is breaking the community rules I'm really really sorry.) I'm at a point where I don't even know if I ever wanted to recover in the first place, but at the same time all I want is to eat everything without any guilt. I'm sorry."
"EH ""Kicking In"" after a few months – why?","I'm curious – why does it often take a few months for EH to really ""kick-in"" (as opposed to starting more quickly after beginning the process of re-nourishing?) Is there a ""scientific"" explanation for this? Or what podcasts/interviews out there have you found to be most instructive on the topic? I feel like I was nourishing myself in more substantial amounts for about four months before EH swept in with a vengeance. It's been here for about three months now, even though I've gone from a BMI of 14 to 18 – I imagine it won't let up until I reach my set point? I want to trust my body but these episodes have been incredibly difficult to weather from a both a physical and emotional standpoint.  "
Extreme Hunger,"I am currently attempting recovery by slowly upping my intake, but I am very afraid of this extreme hunger... will it go away eventually once I've been consistently eating my maintenance calories? The thing is, I am at a normal healthy weight that I am happy with and would like to maintain/not gain a lot of weight. I was overweight and had unhealthy habits before my ED, but now I understand nutrition and I want to have a normal relationship with food while remaining a healthy weight and having healthy habits so I dont think ""honoring"" the hunger by eating like 5000+ calories is a good idea for me. I just want to know if the extreme hunger will subside without me having to do anything like that."
welp,Anyone in the US with Medicaid that has gotten treatment covered(not new jersey or new york) ? How? Also what to do if no place will take you because of weight? I need help- I wouldn't have asked for help if I could have gotten to that weight by myself.. tf. 
recovery,i know I’m far to young for this app but I’ve been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa since I was 11 now I’m 12 and I can’t have any food freedom i cant eat anything without the overwhelming guilt coming along with it i want to live my childhood I want to eat anything and everything but I just cant. i feel so alone :( can anyone give me any tips to recover i can’t live in a whole anymore
Can I be considered recovered even though I’m underweight?,I don’t have ed thoughts or behaviors anymore. Can I consider myself recovered?
"""baby fat"" cheeks","ive been eating decent?¿ for the past three weeks and i am noticing my face has so much fat on it.. its really bothering me and making it hard for me. is this fluids? will it go down?
ive only really restricted eating for two months is this normal even though it was a short amount of time?

im so scared of getting a double chin because of this. i am constantly body checking it ^"
Bingeing during recovery?,I relapsed after 2 years but it’s only lasted about a month and a half. I decided earlier this week to try and recover again and since then I’ve been binge eating every day. This doesn’t feel like recovery but I’m hoping it’s just part of the process and will go away once my body trusts I’m not going to starve anymore. Does anyone have experience with this? I don’t want to be trading out a restrictive eating disorder for a binge eating disorder…
Healthy weight gain,"I am a 28 year old female, about 5'10 in height and weigh 123lbs currently. I weight closer to 140 before I lost the weight and would love to get back there. 
I have been struggling to find foods that I enjoy eating. I feel like lately my body is hungry but literally nothing sounds appetizing so I tend to eat crappy things or just drink a protein shake to at least get something into me. 

Please no ""just eat"" advice. If the answer were that easy I wouldn't be here. I am looking for simple foods or ways to get myself to slowly consume more food in a healthy way as I'd love to gain the weight back. 

I am also physically active. I work with children, I walk my dogs everyday and I try to do a little at home workout or stretching everyday.

Thanks in advance:)"
What would happen if I ignored/failed to honor EH?,"Accidentally , purposefully, or just because I don’t have access to enough food, what would happen if the increased need to eat was not honored during recovery?"
Trauma after long anorexia,It is a normal thing that in recovery process I feel anxiety when I don't exactly know when I will eat next meal? It is a sort of post-anorexia trauma of human organism?
Late stage recovery question - social boundary setting regarding meals and snacks,"I have come a really long way with a lot of things but one of the hardest remaining obstacles is when friends make social plans with absolutely no mention of when snacks and meals will fit into the plan. Went to a social event that started at 6pm directly from work (yes, I had breakfast, am snack, lunch, and PM snack around 3pm before coming). My blood sugar tends to dip like clockwork around 530-6. I had to tell my friend that I have to leave the event around 7pm when my blood sugar just dipped way too low and I’m just still baffled how anyone schedules things in the middle of normal meal times. 

I realize people just “eat afterwards” but this never works for me because it’s just too long. I hate having to just leave to get food when the other person claims to be fine. When I told my friend she was like “no problem” and I recognize now I should have just said no to the event in the first place, or said that I need dinner first. Does anyone else have tips for overcoming this? I stick to the 6x a day schedule and I’m very stressed when there’s no opportunity to keep up with it. I had the same problem earlier today in a work meeting that went 12pm-4pm WITH NO BREAK. I literally just got up, missed part of the meeting because I excused myself and made food around 3pm which is already late for my PM snack because my blood sugar was dipping and it was time (I feel the hunger, I’d like to respond to it). 

I sometimes feel like recovery has made me a more consistent eater and more responsive to my hunger signals than the normies around me. And i hate the social pressure of having to be the odd one out and excuse myself because I’m in need and other people claim to be fine. Yes I do carry snacks with me at all times in a variety of forms like jerky, nuts candy (protein, fat and carb) but snacks simply do not replace/make a meal. Even in the same quantities. I tried to last with a snack from my bag (a premade bubble tea drink and a protein bar) at the event (I left group and sat down somewhere until I felt better) and it really didn’t work (brought me from very urgent to “need dinner asap”). I left an hour later. 

I know this is a people pleasing issue and difficulty speaking up for my needs but any comments or advice is welcomed or if you relate please comment. Also, I do have an eating disorder, aware nutritionist who has helped me pack better snacks that will keep my blood sugar more stable between meals as well as suggest meals that are a mix of nutrients and foods to keep more stable as well, I don’t actually think there is anything special about me. I’m just very sensitive to my bodily sensations and blood sugar, or maybe I’m not maybe I’m the one who eats (3 meals 3 snacks) when others ignore their body but it drives me bonkers because I can’t and won’t do that."
eating for the first time this week..,this is my first actual meal of this week. i’m lowkey shaking rn.
Oily,Im 3 weeks in recovery and today in particular (after making no changes to my eating or haircare) my skin and hair have become really really oily
Advice needed,"I need advice

Background information: I was diagnosed w an eating disorder (anorexia). I have been in hospital recovery for 3 months, been discharged, and relapsed terribly. Recently with family I have been in all-in recovery.( Please search it up if you dk what it is) I have been in all in recovery for about 3months now. During the first couple weeks of it, I gained some weight and my family has acted proud. Now, I've suddenly been either losing or not gaining (I haven't weighed for my mental state) and everyone is invalidating me. I have been in my extreme hunger phase and experiencing a shit ton of mental hunger. I always honor it and I eat whatever I crave and want now. Most of the time I feel like I'm binging. I could eat 10 or more pieces of chocolate at once and multiple packs of sweets like brownies and cookies. However tho for some reason, since I'm not gaining a lot of weight anymore and still ""skinny"", my family has been screaming at me and saying I'm still ""anorexic"" and I still don't honor my cravings and eat whatever I want whenever I want, WHEN IN REALITY, IM DOING EXACTLY THAT AND SO MUCH MORE. Everyday after meals I feel like I've binged but I ignore it. I'm eating enormous amounts of chocolates, cookies, and other sweets etc. But everyone is just attacking me now and I feel like giving up. Like I wanna kms now."
Do anorexics keep their house warm in the summer?,"My aunt's a former anorexic. She now eats just enough to survive. Anyways, my mom doesnt like to go over to her apartment because she doesn't run air conditioning. It's 88 inside when she went over there not too long ago and my mom couldn't stand the heat so she left quickly. I got to thinking I wonder if she keeps it so hot because the heat makes you eat less when it's hot? I know I always don't eat a lot in the extreme heat. We live in North Carolina in the South East. I told my mom my thoughts about her showing anorexia signs again as a result of no air conditioning and she says that could be true. I do not judge anyone by the way just concerned. I suffer from other mental illnesses so I know what it's like. My mom had her admitted years ago that turned her life around. Just thought maybe shes showing signs of anorexic tendencies again."
It gets better,"Two things I believed I would never have again were Boba tea and waffle cones of ice cream. I remember the first time I had them in recovery, it was a huge deal and I thought about it for days on end both before and after. Now I have both on a fairly regular basis and don’t think much of it. I never thought I would be here so if you are in a similar place to where I was, justt know that it does get better. It takes time and effort, but it does!"
"Feeling like I need ""permission"" to recover","No one in my life knows I have this disorder. I've had it for a decade and only recently was able to admit it to myself. People close to me see that I am underweight but don't know the full problem. I thought I was only desirable if I were skin and bones. I told my parents and one close friend that my doctor wants me to gain weight. When I told my parents the weight my doctor wants me to achieve they flat out just said ""no"". My friend also thinks the number is too high. It makes me feel like I shouldn't try, but deep down I want to reach the goal my doctor gave me. Part of me feels like my parents and friend are making this number bigger in their minds than it would actually look on me. I guess I just want someone to tell me it's okay to reach this goal. That I won't be ""too big"" and gross and undesirable. That it's okay to get healthy. I'm tired of looking and feeling sick but I have no support currently."
Hips and knees,"I’ve turned 30this year and have struggled with my Ed for about 2-3 years now. I have been very UW but have already made quite some recovery process.

Now ive noticed that after a walk, I always get these wobbly knees and lately also a feeling of unstable hips? Its not (yet) painful but is this something that is permanent damage? I feel so old.

I have not had a bone scan but have not had a proper period in 3 years."
Getting stressed cus period is not coming,"I have been eating but not getting anywhere sometimes I feel stuck anxious depressed but I'm still going
Also if someone lost their periods and got it 
Share tips?❤️"
Fluids and recovery,It is a normal thing that I drink a lot of fluids (mostly diet coke) in recovery? Why?
i’m scared for my life,i was doing so good until a week ago. the headaches have came back i can’t eat anything i haven’t ate anything for a week besides like fvcking gum and water i’m throwing up constantly sobbing over the toilet begging God to heal me i’m loosing hope for myself. i kinda wanna kms but i can’t leave my boyfriend and my mom. every time i look in the mirror i just cry in disappointment because i regret st@rving my self during my beginning teen year. and my hair is slowly falling off too.
I get so sad and doom feeling each night,"Do u think it’s due to anorexia? Usually I restrict a lot at night and my heart just feels so sad I can’t take it.  It’s sometimes hard to breathe. That’s how sad I get.  I have to wake up early tomorrow so I can’t drink about it.  I don’t know what to do. I also live alone and don’t have a partner. My heart just gets so heavy sometimes and I ruminate about all the failures in my life.  I’m 34.  Can anyone relate? 😞 would eating a meal really make a difference?

I miss the “high” feeling I used to get going to bed hungry.  Now I just feel so profoundly empty and sad inside"
I have a question and I’m 6 months in recovery,"So, it’s been 6 months in my recovery and I feel really happy and about that but it got me overweight and I’m gaining a lot of stomach fat, I was never overweight and never had a lot of stomach fat before my eating disorder. Why is this happening to me? I see a lot of other people recovered and during recovering are healthily fit and average but I’m not."
For those who are struggling but keep going…,"I’m so proud of you. You are valid, and worthy of recovery! Every step you take In the right direction is a victory, and honestly worth celebrating. Some days will be easier and some days harder. Remember that the ED voice is a liar. If the big picture looks overwhelming, focus on just a snapshot. What positive steps are immediately in front of you? 

Sending you virtual hugs.♥️"
I don’t know where to start,"I’m 15 years old and a few months ago I was deep in anorexia, ever since I met my boyfriend he’s encouraged me to recover but it’s been so difficult to eat more. It’s like I’ve plateaued and I haven’t been able to gain much weight, I try to bulk so my workouts can be more effective but when I think I’m done for the day I haven’t even met the calorie limit and it’s so hard to maintain proper protein intake I don’t know what to do it’s so hard will I ever recover? Will my mind ever be free from this feeling? When will I look at myself in the mirror and not feel utterly repulsed when will I step on the scale at the doctors office and not feel horrible for gaining a POUND. Anorexia is the crux of my being and I want to cascade into myself until I become a whole new person again.
Is recovery possible?"
Desperately need help,"TW: Numbers, they have been blacked out and not entirely necessary for context but do help to understand my situation

Need guidance in starting recovery.

My method is to increase my cals from >!1080!< up to be TDEE which apparently is around >!1550!<. Im not sure how quickly is safe to do so because my bmi is >!15!<.

Also what do I do about my exercise? I have a good amount of muscle and am very lean and don’t want to completely lose this as before relapsing I worked hard for this muscle at the gym.

I cut back from >!40k!< a day to >!35-36k!< currently but eventually want to get it to between >!10-20k!<. 

I've cut out anything high intensity and my steps are decreasing yet I've continued to lose with very little variation to how many calories I've been eating till now.

I’m really worried because two days in a row I hit a nee LW and a hospital admission is being threatened like TODAY if I don’t get my shit together. 

Please please any help is appreciated."
Advice desperately needed,"My best friend keeps bragging about st!rving herself and not eating meals. It's really been detrimental to my recovery, and while I am trying to get better and push through the thoughts, I keep flip flopping between moderate restriction and being scared of food but still eating it. It's scary and I just want it to stop, and she's the person who's making it worse. I don't want to abandon her though; she understands my feelings and has been through very similar things so I don't want her to feel bad. But god, my heart just feels like exploding into flames whenever she brags again. "
Getting fit after recovery (possibly triggering),"For some background I've been recovered for roughly 5 yrs now and in recovering and weight restoring I was left chubby and more un fit than I had ever been in my whole life. This was incredibly tough on me and made recovery so hard. I've fought with myself over and over again about how to start feeling good in my body and how to get that body that makes me feel good but in a healthy way. And so for the past year I've started to work on gaining muscle back and getting fit again (with no diet restrictions). Before anorexia I was fit and slightly athletic and I've just been trying to get that strength and health back but every time I start seeing results I get scared I will relapse. Because when I start to lose weight it triggers me and I feel like if I don't stop I'll relapse. I start to obsess over my body again, getting fears of weight gain and finding myself restricting on accident. I also start obsessively body checking. Im talking going to the bathroom multiple times an hour *every hour* just to body check. I just cant stop being so triggered when I see myself getting slim again, I was always slightly underweight before anorexia due to having mild hyperthyroidism but after recovery I wasn't prepared to ever get that body back. I had already accepted that I was never going to look how I did peak ED again, firstly because I don't want an ED again and secondly because I was 12-15 at the time of my ED. But when I look in the mirror lately what I see is not too far off from my body at 15, and its horrifying. I just don't know what to do. I really want to be fit and healthy again but the weight loss side of it is extremely triggering, I don't even know what advice I'm looking for maybe I'm just looking for someone who can relate but this is the problem thats been plaguing me since January. "
I am still losing weight?,"I don’t get it - but (I know it’s bad) I’m not complaining…
I’ve been forced into recovery.  I haven’t been counting calories for the past week because I just know it will crush me, depress me, stress me - tip me over the edge - but I have to be going over my TDEE (numbers!! 
>!1450 calories!<).  Nonetheless, according to my daily weighing (🫥 I know I shouldn’t) I’m still losing weight????? Also according to my obsessive body checking (🫥) I’m still getting smaller???? What is going on????

I’m not complaining (*I know that’s wrong*) but it can only be one of two things:
1. I have a physical illness causing weight loss, or
2.  I’ve screwed my metabolism and now I process everything super fast.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any ideas? Will it end….???"
I am eating a lot,"I decided to recover like few days ago. First after long starvation and bmi in 13s I had terrible time switching to food (heart pain and swollen belly, diarrhea all day and night). Today it's already fine physically but I am HUNGRY. Should I stop myself? it seems like I can eat without any bad physical consequences, then I sleep and I eat again. I don't feel guilty because I will gain. I WANT TO gain. But I am feeling like I should go slow. Should I go slowly or is it fine not to? Will the hunger stop eventually? Or do I trigger it to stay that way by eating?"
Is this an a a symptom,So I been dealing with migraines since 2017. During that time and up until the last two years they would get really bad and I would get them a lot (I thought i got them cause my friends who I saw every day were loud). If I had one I couldn’t focus straight and it was just awful. Thankfully they don’t come that often anymore and they arnt that bad cause the doctor gave me meds for it but I just realized that I haven’t asked if anyone else had to deal with this so is this an Ana symptom or do I just have bad luck
An Offering,
Teen recovery,"Hey y’all lovelies,

I’m a teen and I lost my period for over half a year now. Will not recovering my period lead to stunted growth in my hips and breasts? Is this due to low estrogen? ❤️ much love to you all."
Feeling validated by other ways than using behaviours?,My therapist once told me that I was using ED behaviours to feel validated in sickness. She says validation is a feeling. Feelings are internal and trying to express them from the exterior (by using behaviours) isn’t effective. So I have to find other ways to get into my head that I’m sick enough as I am. Could anyone who worked this out give me advice?
Call For valuable Feedback - ED App Idea,"Dear Community,  
hi! I'm a current psych undergrad working on a project I would love to hear your thoughts on. Please spread the word because Feedback from people affected by eating disorders, especially severe ones, is very valuable in this case.  
While working together with people affected by eating disorders for my internship and organising workshops on the topic, I found a common factor that contributes to ED-behaviors, especially in adolescents: calorie counting apps. I was thinking about how this problem could be solved, because usually recommending them to delete the app just leads to them hiding it.  
Seeing as bodily hunger and satiety signals aren't very present in people with chronic/persistent EDs, eating within a healthy calorie range also becomes harder.  
This lead me to a thought that maybe tracking the things eaten isn't the problem, but it's the numbers. Hm. Maybe an app that tracks calories without showing numbers, just giving a soft colour-coded signal if the user is eating over or under their recommended daily average to get to a healthy BMI which also tracks if the user experienced hunger or satiety signals and offers mindfulness exercises for thoughts of binging/restricting calories.  
Target Audience: People with severe/chronic EDs who are severely over/underweight.  
Main goal: offer support and promote a healthier relationship with food for those dealing with eating disorders, whether it's overcoming overeating or undereating.  
App Concept:  
The app aims to help users better understand their bodily signals of hunger and satiety. It discreetly tracks calorie intake using color-coding (no numbers), gently guiding users towards their daily caloric goals. The app also includes a mindfulness feature to help cope with binge urges, providing a holistic approach to managing eating habits and emotions.  
Your Feedback Matters:  
I would love to hear from you about your thoughts on this app concept. Your insights are incredibly valuable as we work to refine and improve the app. If you or someone you know has experience with eating disorders, your inquiries and feedback would be immensely appreciated. Here are some questions to get the conversation started:  
Does the app's concept resonate with you? Is it something you believe could offer meaningful support?  
What features stand out to you the most? Is there anything you would like to see added or adjusted?  
How do you feel about the color-coded calorie tracking approach? Does it seem like a helpful and sensitive way to approach this aspect?  
The mindfulness feature is designed to help with coping strategies. What are your thoughts on its potential effectiveness?  
Any suggestions for app names or additional features that could enhance the overall experience?  
Please feel free to share your thoughts, concerns, and questions in the comments. Your input will play a significant role in shaping this project. Let's work together to create a tool that can truly make a positive impact!  
Thank you so much in advance!"
I don’t know if it’s mental hunger…,"Recently I found myself wanting to be hungry. Like I eat a meal and am full, but I find myself wanting to be hungry a few hours later because I want to eat something or eat more. I don’t know if that goes along with mental hunger, or if it’s just because I want to taste different things that I spent so long not letting myself. I still don’t want to gain weight 😞 I just want to eat. It’s kind of a weird phenomenon, and it makes me worried that I’m having tendencies to binge if I’m wanting to eat when I’m not hungry. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
when is a good time to reintroduce exercise,"i’m about 8 mos into recovery from anorexia (3 mos self guided/2 mos outpatient/3mos checked into intensive outpatient - daily program). i’m working with my treatment team and have listened to them with meal
plan, strategies etc. my vitals are now stable, i’ve put on a good amount of weight and have weight restored, labs are doing ok. i also follow the meal
plan given to me for the most part (few snacks here and there might be missed). i have hardly exercised since march of this year. 
for about the past 4 weeks i’ve reintroduced yoga (of varying intensity) and have gone on walks. 
i don’t want to reverse the progress i’ve made and yet i do want to exercise more - feel stronger, fitter, less lethargic and more energized. i don’t want to exercise compulsively again, though that was a big thing in my anorexia. i’m wondering how to reincorporate slightly more intense exercise. there are thoughts in my mind of joining a gym, getting dumbbells at home and working out at home, or going on outdoor runs. im afraid of restarting because i don’t want the compulsive over exercising again, but im wondering if others have been in the same place and have advice. i’ve spoken to my team and they’ve told me proceed with caution but exercise is good right now - just don’t make hard and fast compulsive rules and focus on what’s fun and makes me feel good. 
would love advice."
Scared of developing?,"Hey everyone Im looking for maybe some clarity or something? While analysing my life im thinking that the reason i got into anorexia and out of it is because i just want to be noticed? Bassicaly i was overweight in like 6th grade and was bullied for it. That summer i make big plans on losing weight and i do and that just stays like that. So i was like that for like 5 years(comfortable underweight not too much my height/weight just and everything else just chill lol). Then corona and lockdown hits and i gain some weight(starting to develop some attributes(boobs and generally figure). I get bullied again by my sister for being overweight(i was on the lower end of NORMAL bmi) and everything spirals down again. I start counting calories and stuff where i eventually get to really dangerous numbers. Get warned about doctors and stuff, but what really put me into recovery was looks - people looking at me like im sick and often acting like i cant do shit. Im like ok im too noticeable again and go into recovery where im just chilling for like half a year now(got into body that isnt looking sick but neither anything outstanding in any way. So i guess im scared to get past that ?weight? that would allow developing in that i dont get asked for id or if im really 18 lol i guess i just dont want to stand out as much as possible"
Dealing with guilt?,"I finally decided to try and recover about a week ago, I’m still counting calories but have been trying to raise my intake by about 15 per day so that it adds up quickly but is low enough to not be as scary. But the guilt from seeing how much it adds up is really getting to me and I’ve started to try and fall back into my old allowance and my urges to use old bad coping skills have been getting bad again. What should I do? One part of me says keep going because of that “feel the fear and do it anyway” quote. And the other says to stop because I’m taking it too fast and I’m not sure what to do"
What happens now?,"
Ive been in recovery and going to therapy for a few months now and was cleared as weight restored a couple months ago. However, nothing seems to be working. I’m still giving in to my Ed thoughts and have managed to loose some weight. My therapist is now trying to scare me into recovering but I can’t. What’s going to happen next if nothing gets better?"

"GF is struggling hard with extreme hunger, appealing for advice","My girlfriend has been battling anorexia since 2021 and for the past 16 or so months she's been on, overall, a very bumpy upward trend towards recovery. This is after hitting such a low point that she briefly ended up in a psychiatric facility to avoid ending herself.

She's gone from a starvation amount of calories per day at her worst to something around maintenance amounts or more regularly, plus vitamin supplements, and her physical health has improved a lot. And she's done a fair bit of psychological healing via therapy, but isn't out of the woods yet at all.

And in recent weeks she has recovered enough that she has entered the stage of extreme hunger. The lack of control over her eating and the resulting weight gain is destroying her emotionally. And she's caught in a cycle of over-eating, vomiting, and feeling despair and helplessness.

Does anyone have any tips to offer to get her through this? She's talking like she wants to give up and go back to starvation. Something needs to be done about this out-of-control hunger before she hits a breaking point. She's done so well to get this far and I don't want her to have to re-do her progress all over again."
Returning to Life After Treatment,"Hi,
I just got out of 7 months in treatment and I feel lost. I do not know what to do with all me extra time. I sorta feel like Brooks from Shawshank redemption. I’m a Ph.D. Student so I am returning to that but life just feels strange. Because of my AN I do not have any friends outside of treatment and it feels like those relationships are gone now that I’m discharged. Can anyone relate and how do you cope?"

Recovered but need to gain more weight for ivf,"Hi
I recovered to a good point. My bmi was still low but as far as I could tell I had no health problems. It just seemed to be natural for me. Now I have to gain more for ivf and it's freaking me out. After nothing, I've suddenly put on a few pounds and I'm feeling the urge to fall into old behaviours of not eating.
I feel so selfish and guilty because really im not doing this for me but I can't stop worrying about the weight gain

Any advice or support would be appreciated!"
Stop the urge to move/ being busy ; learning how to relax,"Hi!   
I've been in recovery for multiple years now and feel better than ever. I can eat without guilt, and what I want. I do have a healthy body for me and my eating habits are pretty normal. So big win here!!   
Nevertheless, one residual of my ED is the inability to relax or the urge to move a lot. I compensate this as it is part of my identity to be busy all of the time. I pretty much have no down time and when I am alone, without any duty (academic, friend meetup etc.) I feel very anxious and driven to do something. I also do not really know what I enjoy just for relaxation.   
My question is: How did you learn to relax and how do you do it? Do you have any practical advices? "
Residential Treatment,"Hi, I'm considering residential treatment for AN but I'm scared. I've had AN for 7 years.
My fears mostly focus on if I will be able to recover if I go through a treatment center. I've been in a hospital program when I was first diagnosed 3 times. I've worked with therapists and RDs since. 
I'm hoping a treatment center will really be able to help me build the foundation for lasting recovery.
Right now I am looking at Laureate in Tulsa , Center for Discovery in McLean VA,  Aslana St. Louis, and Aster in VA.
Does anyone know anything about them?
Was residential treatment helpful to you? I've seen people going back several times for treatment and it has me discouraged..

Additional questions, does the longer you have had your ED mean it will take longer for your hunger cues to return?

Update: I've narrowed it down mainly to Laureate and Aslana because they offer housing options for out of state people. I've started inquiries to Center for Change in Orem Utah. Aster in , VA is still on the table, I just don't have too much information on them."
Reading issues and anorexia recovery,"I'm trying to recovery but I still have (and even bigger last times) issues with reading and keeping focus on text. Also, I'm somehow scared (?) to read more, because I'm afraid that I will not remember what I just read (because of thinking only on food related things)

Will it eventually stop when I recover myself?"
Stopping Halfway?,"What motivated you to fully weight restore as opposed to stopping midway through the journey? I feel like I'm at this point now, as most of the truly acute physical symptoms have passed and I'm wondering why I have this job to do to continue to gain weight (as opposed to maintain where I am now)."
Does anyone here feel like they recovered quickly?,"I’m not sure if I’d considered myself fully recovered. I still get bad thoughts but my mindset really changed after I made an effort to recover. It took only about a couple of months after trying. I was wondering if anybody else’s mindset change quickly after trying to recover. 

I’m not sure if this feeling’s going to last."
Will my period ever go back to how it was?,"Hi all! I’ve been in recovery for three years now and besides an occasional slip up I’ve been doing very well! However before I really started struggling with anorexia I had a horrible period. I would have PMDD symptoms before my period and during I would have terrible cramping and I could go through a tampon in two hours. It would also always last a full week. Post recovery my period is hardly a problem. It’s lasts about 2-4 days, very light after day 1, and minimal if any cramping. I know this kinda seems like it would be a blessing but it’s honestly freaking me out a bit. Has anyone else experienced their period not going back to how it was even while being in recovery for a bit? Is this something I should be concerned about? Thanks!! 💕"

Hunger Cues and Meal Plans (support)?,"Hi, I'm new here.
I have been trying to recover from AN since 2016. In the last year I have put on more weight but never ate at consistent times. 
I'm embarrassed to admit I started BF at 11 a.m ish sometimes later. Exercise for 1 hr+ eat 'lunch' at 3:30 waited a bit then exercised some more. Then maybe started dinner after I got it ready at 11:00p.m. id go to bed at 4:00am.
I explain this because I have a problem with overexercise and I still felt obligated to eat what my RD assigned. As I said, very embarrassing to admit and it did not feel good. I basically avoided most of my food all day then felt obligated by guilt since I exercised to complete the meal plan.  I think Tabitha Farrar has a name for this behavior. I didn't view it as me slipping to a different Ed. I'm sure you can infer
For the past 1.5 weeks I have been eating on a much more normal schedule. My last meal now ends about 8:30. My ED now has me exercising less and eating more.
Now that the explanation is over can someone answer some questions for me?

1. For anyone who has had an ED for long time, how quickly did your hunger cues return?

2. Is quitting the exercise the only way I can truly break the habit? Did you do this? Did you return to exercise after you were in solid recovery and still have a healthy relationship with it?

3. Did following a meal plan with set times help you? (Growing up my family didn't have any set meal times so 3 meals 3 snacks is very hard for me). 

4. What helped you deal with the negative thoughts and feelings (helpful mantras etc)?

5. A bit off topic but has anyone been in residential treatment at Aslana St. Louis, Aster in VA, Laureate in Tulsa, or Center for Discovery in McLean?  I'm looking hard at Laureate and CFD-McLean.

Please be kind. I'm sorry the post is so long."
Periods back in ed?,Does anybody took medicines to get their period back in Ed cus I'm taking it rn . How did you felt
"Outsiders, Outliers","I'm interested in hearing from folks who might have ""unusual"" experiences or ways through this. Has anyone

A) Weight restored but not gained their physical hunger signals back?

B) Recovered while running or weight lifting throughout part the process – via enjoying the feeling of getting faster/stronger? Or even if it was from a more ""disordered"" place, did it still ""work"" for you?

C) Adopted Intermittent Fasting, a more ketogenic diet, or any other structure that may be considered ""disordered"" by some here – whether during the process of re-nourishment or afterwards – as a means to have a relationship with food that works for them?

D) ""Recovered"" at an underweight BMI? I'm curious how people think about ""constitutional thinness"" vs anorexia.

I really miss hunger. Did you gain back TRUE hunger/ painful hunger pangs?,"I'm asking that because, ue to restricting, the  hunger feeling is very weak. I want to eat again when hungry (not because it's the time) - I mean, to satisfy that hunger, because everything tastes better with HUNGER (actually, I miss the growling, the empty stomach feeling and the  painful hunger pangs)

:/  
Any suggestions?"
Swelling in recovery,"I have been in recovery for around 2 years and I still have pretty bad swelling. I got in around the 4 month mark in recovery where it was the absolute worst. It is still there. It isn’t as bad anymore but there is still a lot. I’m bit tired of seeing my face and body swollen to this extent, the pain is still very much present and I often wonder when it will go away.

Has anyone else experience this? What helped you?"
new peanut butter addiction,Has anybody become insanely addicted to peanut butter since the start of their recovery? It used to be one of my biggest fear foods now I could eat a whole jar if i wanted 😅
How do you not want to kill yo self when shopping for new clothes because you are bigger now?,"I don’t mean that literally, but I severely trigger myself and hate myself because I am on the border of plus-sized now, and overweight after being quite anorexic my whole life. I just want to look cute and wear cute flattering clothes that actually fit my body, but instead I get triggered to allllll hell and back when I go to get new clothes because the stupid fucking size keeps going up.     
I’m trying not to hate myself, for having done recovery, but at the time it was kinda forced on me and I have these moments where I look at myself now- fat and totally unrecognizable compared to how pretty and thin I used to be, and I regret it. I wish I could go back in some ways even though I know it wasn’t healthy back then either.
Also the ubiquity of photoshop for all online shopping does NOT help."
The best thing I’ve ever done,"I just moved into college for my senior year and it is the first year I have been in recovery. I have a small mirror in my bathroom, but I did not bring my full-size mirror. Obviously not having a mirror doesn’t make my thoughts just go away, but it means that I’m less able to body check and I have gotten to the point where I hardly think about or want to do it at all. I used to hear people talking about getting rid of mirrors during recovery, and I thought that was just kind of pointless because my thoughts are there regardless, I’m not walking by the mirror every time I walk across my room, I’m a lot less interested in body checking. It is genuinely the best thing I’ve done for my mental health, and I highly recommend it!"
I think my gf has a ed,"I think my gf has a Ed she’s showing every sign jogging nonstop, I haven’t seen her eat in months, WAY skinnier than before and “I’m not hungry” “ I already ate“  and wearing baggy clothes. I’m really worried about her. Should I suggest therapy?"
Bodychecking,"Feeling a bit sad at the time and life I wasted during my ED. Added all my Bodychecking pics to an album on my phone, mostly so I can look back and reflect. My ED was active from March-July this year and in that time I took 955 bodychecking pics. I’m now able to look back and see how truly ill I looked, even though I’ve only gained a small amount of weight in my recovery so far. The saddest part is I didn’t even realise how disordered it had become, it was just part of me and I accepted that at the time. I’m beginning to love my body for what it can do for me and I feel so deeply sad that I put it through so much during those months. What an insidious and evil illness anorexia is."
Why do I binge on carbs so much even tho they're supposed to make you feel full?,"I literally just finished half a tray of Mac and cheese, around 10 pieces of bread with ketchup and mustard and *half* a jar of jam.
My stomach felt like a bottomless pit till I finished half the jar of jam and the sugar made me feel sick"
Literal recovery nightmares and dreams,"I’m only day three into recovery, and I failed miserably yesterday.  Nonetheless I woke up this morning in a complete panic after having a nightmare.  About what? About recovery - I dreamt that I had gained weight to the point of becoming overweight, and now my metabolism was so messed up there was nothing I could do to change it.  It was an intense dream that left me really anxious, and I know it’s stupid to say but right now it just doesn’t seem like I’m even meant to recover.  I know I’m only three days in but nothing is going my way, I don’t think I’m strong enough to do this.

Edit:  but I’m still trying.  Half an hour later and one small step at a time - I know it sounds pathetic but I got myself a nice milky coffee. And I’ve decided if that’s all I can do different today, at least I’ve tried and that’s enough.  I just have to keep going."
Night eating… recommendations,"I’m still working out as much as I can, and really only my “safe foods” that are the same foods everyday. I continue to save most of my calories for the evening. Any recommendations to get over night eating and moving food up earlier in the day? I’m so scared I’ll want so many more calories if I do. I have tried a few times but I fall right back to the old pattern."
Ive gotten so fat I want to kms,"5-6 months into recovery. I just saw an old photo of myself and I used to look stunning. I took a picture today and my tummy fat is grotesque and my things are huge. At this point I feel like The choice is between relapsing and dying of Ana or having to kill myself because I can’t keep up like this. Being hungry and dizzy all the time was fucking better than constantly hiding in baggy clothes, ditching seeing friends and being mortified going out in public because I am so afraid someone will notice how fat I’ve gotten. I won’t live life as a fat person!!!! ID RATHER DIE"

Recovery day 2 and already 🫥🫠🫥,"I decided yesterday, for a lot of reasons, to recover.  I ate, and I ate full fat everything.  The guilt is almost surreal, and right now I’m crying into a cup of full cream milk coffee…it doesn’t help that I’ve been subjected to hundreds of basically “thinspo” examples irl at a nearby event I have to go to 😥 what do you guys do to combat the guilt and the need to be skinniest in the room?? Thank you 🙏♥️"
I'm this 🤏🏻 close to relapsing,"My brother today said to me ""looks like you have a bit of a tummy"" which he said like in a silly tone and I know he meant no harm, he meant it in a funny way. But that was enough for me to get triggered. I finished my meal plan for today, but I just cut a LOT of my calories for tomorrow's meal plan. I'm looking at it rn and I know that this is wrong but I can't help it. I can't bring myself to add more thing to my meal plan. And if I don't add now, there's no way I'll eat something unplanned tomorrow especially after that comment. I don't know what I want to hear, but please tell me something smart so I can get back to my senses before I horribly relapse."

"hello! I’m new to the group I hope everyone’s well. I have been in recovery for a year, or about a year.","I was looking in the mirror just before as we all do and noticed how many stretch marks and weight I have gained, I never really had the courage untill now and I never want to again. my stretch marks are quiet beautiful I actually like them, such as a painting but my double chin, I hate. is there a way to get rid of it? Maybe exercises for it? not saying they are bad at all they are beautiful but I just don’t like mine."
Found out today that I’m officially 2 years recovered after going all in. AMA !!,
How fast do symptoms kick in?,"I am going through a tragic loss and have been unable to eat. I forget to eat every day until my boyfriend reminds me when he comes home around 7pm and I eat a small meal. I am definitely under eating and have lost 12 lbs in 5 weeks. Before this I ate enough so it’s only been 5 weeks of this behavior, although I have definitely starved myself in the past although I have never been diagnosed with anorexia formally I have had periods where I barely eat for months and lose a lot of weight. I have never been hospitalized or fainted from this.

I have been dizzy for 2 days and am forcing myself to eat despite feeling nauseous. But it is still hard to walk/stand.

Should I go to a hospital for dehydration or will it go away if I just eat more, i would like to avoid a hospital and try and just eat enough and set a reminder on my phone."
Unmotivated…..,I hope someone has experienced this. So I have been eating 5k literally everyday for the past month. Yes I have gained weight but everyone still does not believe me because I look the same. How much do I need to eat to look “normal”. I’m so confused and tired.
How do you make meal plans everyday?,"Like how would you go to the store and get food for a meal plan and keep it consistent without it being the same meal everyday, I have apps that create meal plans but I don’t know how to keep it consistent 

Like having meals with certain ingredients, like let’s say eggs, but it being consistent but not the same meal if that makes sense 

Everyday your planning but you can reuse ingredients and not run out quick 

How did you do it?"

i dont know what to do,"im a 16, i developed anorexia at the age of 13. i never got my period, potentially stunted my growth, and i still look like a 12 year old.
im doin better now and im am at a helthier weight but i wouldnt say that im fully recovered. should i see a doctor? or what do you advise me to do?"
Recover help!,"I am extremely frustrated. I started the recovery all in journey April . I did good for the first 2 months but then had an appointment with my general doctor. She literally weighed me 3 times and said it was only because she doesn’t normally see such fast changes and “progress”. Subconsciously I started to restrict. Before I knew it I was afraid, and anxious about eating anything and everything that was not one of my safe foods. The thing that kills me inside is that I have weight restored and look “normal or healthy” but in fact feel excavator the same mentally. I feel like I need to loose weight and start over again now. I am already uncomfortable in my body and going all in again will make me obese. 🥺"
Hypoglycemia - Anyone gotten diabetes post recovery?,"Currently have a continuous glucose monitor. I always knew the years of being restrictive/orthorexic from 15-22 would come back to haunt me, but I'm wondering how bad this has gotten for some people. 

I'm open with my doctors about my past restrictive eating, but I don't see an endo until September and would like any anecdotal evidence I can bring to them about ED and hypoglycemia and if it has ever gotten worse instead of better. 

* Also trigger warning for checking my profile history. I have a post talking about weightloss w/ photos... there's a lot of nuiance in it that I didn't go into because it was not the place nor time and it still isn't."
Extreme sweating,"Hi everyone, hope you're having a good day. I wanted to ask you something, if you have any experiences with this. My anorexia started 2 years ago and I'm still struggling. I've gained almost everything back, but I'm still missing my periods. I think I still should be eating more. But this summer is terrible. It's surely hot outside but I've never been like this. I'm sweating like crazy. It's definitely not normal. Like literally I have wet neck, back, face and arms. I just wanted to ask if you think this is due to the missing period? Like my body thinks it's in menopause?  
Thank you for your answers."
Tips for comments on weight gain,"Any tips with what to say to people post recovery weight gain? And how to cope with their comments? 

I’ve certainly gained a decent amount of weight in recovery and have returned to my workplace. I haven’t seen some of my colleagues since March, and it’s only day 2 and three people have said I ‘look so different’ and one asked me who I was. They never knew me prior to my anorexia diagnosis. 

I’m medically weight restored now but still experiencing extreme hunger and trying my best to honour it despite the guilt. 

I know I shouldn’t let it impact me, and I know I’m happier and healthier, but I’ve had to sneak to the bathroom for a couple of good cries. 

I guess I’m mourning my old body which doesn’t make sense because my old body wasn’t a good body. 

But anyway, I’m just asking for some responses I can give these colleagues? Or any tips anyone found useful in their own recovery to combat such comments and not let it halt me from continuing to honour my hunger. 

Thank you all for your time ❤️"
My Ed ruined my relationship help please,"My boyfriend and I were together for almost 4 years. At some point in the middle, I developed anorexia and it was very bad. I was slowly dying and it caused a lot of emotional distress on my boyfriend because most of it fell upon him as he was with me most of the time and my family was out of country. After a while I got better and recovered. However, I would still get anorexic thoughts sometimes (some phases I was good mentally others not) but I wouldn’t act on them but I’d start crying having breakdowns because I felt fat or made comments saying I wish I could be anorexic again or that I could starve myself. And at the beginning of my weight recovery it was worse I would hit myself and cut myself but he was always there for me. In the last year I stopped doing that and saying that I wanted to die as frequently as before and it’s better but I still made comments some times saying that I didn’t want to go on my post grad vacation w my family because I didn’t want to eat out bc I didn’t wanna get fat etc. and my boyfriend always listened to comments like that and even if I tried to reduce them they didn’t stop completely. Now we just graduated college we both started a new job will be living about 1 hour away drive which is not much. But last weekend he broke up with me. He said he felt we needed a break for a bit because he felt he was very emotionally drained from having dealt with my ed and was scared of saying something and causing me to relapse etc. and he feels I need to learn how to love or at least accept myself more before being in a relationship. He says he will be here for me if I need anything but he needs some space and he is right we do need space from each other. It is like I was so self absorbed and didn’t see the signs and it must have been so draining seeing someone you love want to kill themselves or constantly wish to go back to that time. I caused a lot of damage and don’t want to cause more and I feel so guilty so guilty and he tells me I shouldn’t but I can’t help it. And we love each other and we are best friends and don’t want to stop talking to each other but we need a break. If it’s meant to be maybe we’ll get back together again someday in the future but he is right I need to work on myself before being in a committed relationship. And my heart is broken. And I am starting a new job I was so happy and excited these past few weeks now I just want to starve and die. We are still unsure if we should stop talking completely. We both think it’s necessary to get over each other but we don’t want to get over each other partially. But idk. Should we cut off communication completely at least for some time? I’ll be broken I always talked to him. I don’t want to let him go I wish I wouldn’t have screwed everything up I wish I was born tall and super skinny and prettier then maybe I never would have developed an eating disorder. The worst thing is I’m not even underweight right now. I’m so sorry."
Help needed..,"I'm just realizing how toxic scrolling through social media, especially the ""recovery"" accounts are for my recovery. But I need something to fill in the gap- something that gives me the dopamine boost and sense of safety but without the toxicity... DAE relate and have recommendations? TIA"
Worried I’m starting ED behaviours again,"Hey everyone, so I’m almost two months into recovery and minus one relapse (luckily only three days) that ended in me being hospitalised, I have been doing really well. I have noticed however that I am doing things that I think might be led by the ED side of my brain. For example, I stopped calorie counting and all exercise to begin with. But now I have started calorie counting again, though I make sure I hit >!2000!< calories every day and have three meals/three snacks a day. I have also started going back to the gym (though I am making sure to not use cardio equipment and having adequate rest days) and have been doing 60+ minute walks with my dog every day. I feel like I’m both in and out of control right now and worried I’m going to spiral into restrictive behaviours again. Any advice?"
how much long term damage have i done?,"TW ed behaviors

i had anorexia for 7 months, lasting from late 13s-mid 14 y/o. i was restricting really really intensely (which is why it was only months before i was forced to recover), i started off eating 800-1000 but the last several months i was doing far below 500 and very commonly staying in the 200 range. i would also occasionally abuse laxatives, but i only went thru like a pack of ex lax the entire 7 months.  i lost my period and i lost 40lbs in about 5 months. i’ve been in recovery for 5 months now and i’ve gained all the weight back, as well as my period and i now have energy and love for running and weightlifting, and overall my physical health seems to be back to normal.
my main question is how much damage did this short period cause? my hunger is still kind of wack as well as heartburn and my digestive system to a small degree, but did this effect my puberty at all ? i’m scared i’ll never be 100% back to normal and that i won’t have a fully complete ted puberty or smth"
Hospitalized and still dont feel valid,"im in the medical hospital right now after losing 4 pounds in the psych ward, on a heart monitor and getting blood taken every day, im under bmi 17.5, AND I STILL DONT FEEL VALID ENOUGH TO RECOVER

anyone have the same experience? any idea on what i can do to feel like i deserve the help im getting?"
I don’t know if I have what it takes to recover anymore,"I have been trying so hard to get better, and I finally started making progress. But no matter how many times I finally think I’m making some good progress, I always just spiral back downward again. I honestly don’t see how I am supposed to do this. I am trying to just keep going, but it is getting so hard to. And if I can’t even *start* recovering without fucking it up, how am I supposed to get better for good? I used to kinda look forward to not being like this all the time, but I honestly can’t even imagine that as a possibility for me anymore"
Anorexia recovery and steps,"Despite eating more I also seem to ""addicted"" myself to making around 20k steps a day. Why so? It is a still sight of anorexia?"
Can someone help me rationalize that eating sugary foods is okay?,"I am in recovery however something I'm having trouble with is being okay with eating added sugar and sweets (e.g. granola bars, pastries, chocolates). This is mostly because during my orthorexia phase, I learned a lot about the negative effects of sugar. I won't detail everything here to avoid triggering others, but the bottom line is, sugar is non-essential for survival and it often comes with negative side effects. My family is also not big on sweets so they typically go days/weeks without sweets and they are totally fine.

However, I crave sweets so much. I want to eat it with every meal. But I can't bring myself to do it because I already know so much information about sugar. Is there a positive reason you can give for me to eat a sweet treat tonight?

*P.S. I really hope I'm not coming across as challenging others for a debate. I am trying to break out of my orthorexia.*"
Someone online is concerned I’m developing a restrictive eating disorder- what do you had done to prevent it in the early days?,"Some context: I gained weight due to some medical treatments and was very unhappy with my body. I also have gender dysphoria that heavily plays into poor self image. I have recently developed some strange behaviours around food. I banned myself from calorie counting early on but I am very particular about what I will eat and how much I will eat and have memorised which foods are the lowest in calories and tend to fill up on those. The most concerning thing for me is I’ve become very territorial over food. If it’s my food, it makes me very tense and irritable if someone else wants a bite or to try some, because it makes it harder to know how much I’ve eaten. I also drink water, diet drinks and peppermint tea to curb hunger. I keep cycling between thinking I don’t have anything to worry about and I’m totally fine and spiralling into thoughts that I’m on the edge of a precipice. My thoughts are consumed by food and what I’m going to eat and how much. I spend most of my time thinking about food and looking at pictures of food and reading recipes. I’m talking to my psychologist about it this week. I feel like there’s nothing to worry about because I’m a ‘normal’ weight."
how long does it take to see progress?,"Hello my fellows i was wondering how long before you started to gain weight into recovery bc i have been in recovery for almost a month and havent made any progress whatsoever and it’s beginning to make me a little worried

How do I maintain my weight?,"I’ve been in anorexia recovery for a little over a month now. I eat almost 2 meals every day now, but I am gaining (or I guess restoring) the weight back really fast. And it pushes me away from continuing eating meals because I don’t want to gain weight. How can I maintain the weight? How can I eat and stay a certain weight and not gain it?"
What do I have to say to my friend to make her feel a bit better?,"My friend hasn't been eating properly for the past 3 years and she lost a lot of weight. Sometimes she talks to me about her not eating for days and I don't know to tell her. I'm scared to say something that will make her feel judged or generally bad, but she expects me to say something. I always tell her that I love her and I like her the way she is but I feel she never listens to me. I don't want to tell her to eat because I think that might not be the best thing to say. Basically I want to understand how to act in these situations to make her feel right?"
I want to relapse,"I really need to get this off my shoulders and I thought maybe I can vent here.(I'm sorry if this doesn't fit)

I'm trying to recover since start of 2023 after having an Ed for 10 years. 
I have normal weight now (I didn't had to gain much to reach it)
But ofc everything I gained is in my thighs and stomach and I feel so fat right now...my breast never really developed because my Ed started when I was like 12 but because of my lack of breast, everything  just looks so ugly and I hate it so much.
I also have plenty of stretch marks, probably because of me always losing and gaining weight
 I just want to relapse and lose weight again,so I can be at least skinny.

I am completely at my limit."
Rant about mixed advice,"I just need a space to rant.

Everywhere I look online I’m getting mixed advice about recovery. People telling me to honour all my hunger (physical and mental) regardless of how much I am eating. But then other people tell me that I should be careful and not “over do” it.
Then I get told that honouring your extreme hunger may lead to binging and other destructive ED habits. 
I also read that honouring your hunger will inevitably end up in a relapse. This is also paired with the phrase “all in recovery doesn’t work”.
So then I question myself constantly.
Is All in a good idea? Should I honour all my hunger? Won’t I end up binging? What if I’m recovering wrong?

The internet is the only access to information I have at the moment as I can’t afford an ED therapist or nutritionist. I’m just so confused and I don’t know how to recover properly.

Thankyou for reading my rant <3

Tips for managing at family events?,"I've been in recovery for a while, but some old behaviours are so hard to let go off. Recently I've really been battling with myself over my weight gain and it's becoming really hard to even leave my room sometimes because I feel so awful about myself. I keep trying to remind myself that this is what my body needs to be healthy but it's really hard sometimes. Even harder today because my family are having a big barbeque/party, and I feel incredibly self conscious. I've changed outfits multiple times, and I'm dreading how I'm gonna look in pictures. But the worst thing is all the food that's gonna be there. I know I'm allowed to eat, and I know I need to eat. But I'm so scared   and I can't even articulate why.

opinions on tracking what i’m eating during extreme hunger,"hey guys :) 
i’ve decided to go all in with recovery again after a year long relapse. last time i got better, not fully better but so much better by going all in, so i decided to do it again. 
however last time i gave up calorie counting. this time i’ve been calorie counting still but counting everything i eat during extreme hunger, which is thousands of calories a day. 
what’re your opinions on this? is it a good idea to keep an eye on my calories, because it feels odd to not know exactly what i’ve eaten. i’m
honouring my cravings, but counting them. or is this a bad idea? 
i’m desperate for opinions, anyone else’s past experiences with this, and advice too x"
I want to build muscle,"I have had an extremely poor relationship with food for the past year. Some days I can eat about 2000 calories, but most days I eat less than 800. 

It has started to affect my period at this point and I want to change and be healthier. I have lost a lot of weight this year, along with a lot of muscle and my ass :( 

I love going to the gym and I want to start getting back into my old groove. My problem is that I need to focus on making myself eat enough. I plan to keep my cardio to a minimum, but I don’t think I will see any results if I start lifting again. I find that working out is fun and helps a lot with stress, but I do want to see my results of my hard work.

Having hard time getting all the food in?,"My ed has made me not enjoy food and see eating as a chore. Especially now that i have to eat so much. This is seriously maybe the only thing holding me back from recovering. Any tips? Also food is sooo expensive. I hate spending all this money on food. I know i need to get healthy, but yeah… i also know of these drinks made for anorexics or other people in need of calories, but they seem expensive."
"Delaying recovery for tomorrow, everyday","I always say this to myself, Im going to start recovery tomorrow! Then I end the day in a calorie deficit, think about food, and then tomorrow comes, then I pick my usual restrictive breakfast, and remain having this stupid disorder. 

I want to change, but the weight gain is terrifying to me , I always put Tabitha Farrahs videos while I do stuff to motivate myself, which kinda works but in a “ill start tomorrow” mentality. 

Im tired, have no energy and feel incredibly guilty for even having an extra piece of fruit. I can’t talk to a professional, thats not an option for me. Does anyone know what to do in this situation?"
Recovery questions,"

Hi there!

I’ve (24YF) been suffering from restrictive anorexia for about 2 years now and found myself very underweight. 

After becoming a bit more medically stable about a year ago, I’ve been in quasi recovery ever since. Kind of like harm reduction. I was eating a lot more but was still medically underweight and still using unhealthy habits. 

Just over a month ago I decided to actually, properly, go all in. The lash month has been hard but it has been amazing. 
I’ve gained a lot of weight (unknown amount), but based on how my clothes are fitting I’m the same size if not bigger than I was pre-ED. 

I have so much more energy, I can laugh again. My social life is coming back and my relationships with my family are rebuilding. 
So many wins. 

My boobs are so sore and I’m constantly bloated, but overall the positives outweigh the negatives. 

I just have a couple of questions now. 

1. This whole month I have been experiencing horrible night sweats, to the point that almost every night I need to change my clothes and switch sides of the bed. When will this taper out? I thought once I was weight restored this would likely stop. 

2. I’m struggling with learning/understanding when my ED brain is talking or when I am just being ‘normal’ for example - yesterday I had breakfast and then I wanted a second bowl of cereal. I wasn’t hungry but I wasn’t full, I knew I didn’t really ‘need’ the bowl of cereal but I wanted it. But I wasn’t sure if I wanted it because I’m just used to eating 2-4 bowls of cereal every day during weight gain, or because I ACTUALLY wanted it. If I didn’t have it, would that be letting the ED win? But then I also can’t continue eating like this forever because the weight gain will just continue… I hope that makes sense 

3. How can I tell if it’s a binge or if it’s honouring mental/physical hunger. For example, tonight I’m planning on baking my favourite cake and eating as much as I want and I can’t wait. But I know I don’t really ‘need’ the cake now that I’m weight restored. Would this be considered a binge?

4. How to deal with those around me assuming I’m ‘cured’ or ‘over it’ now that I’m weight restored. I feel like because I now appear much healthier, those around me assume it’s all done and dusted, but that’s not the case. 

Thank you all for your time."
gaining weight but eating at maintenance,"i’m not in a recovery program, but i decided it’s time to at least stop losing because i’ve damaged my health so much. i started eating at maintenance 3 weeks ago. i hadn’t stepped on the scale since i started this because i was too scared. but this morning i decided to check, and i gained 2lb since i started eating AT MAINTENANCE. how did this happen? i’m not eating enough to gain and i really didn’t make that much of an increase in my intake. i’m also on my period right now so i’m thinking maybe thats what it is, but what else explains it? have i really gained 2 lbs in 3 weeks eating at maintenance?"
How did you stop thinking about food? Why do I think about it all the time?,"Im at a healthy weight now but I still constantly think about food, even after I've just eaten. 
It's mental torture and I really want it to stop. I eat enough every day. I don't limit anything in my diet. I exercise every day (ab 1hr of cardio). 

How did you get over these seemingly obsessive thoughts? And where do they even come from? 
Am I still underfed? 

Sending love to everyone, thank you"
Hypoglycemia?,"DAE have hypoglycemia from intermittent fasting/years of anorexia? Because my mom severely calorie/fat restricted me as a child, I didn’t realize my ex was involving me in his orthorexia until after I left him.

I’m having trouble with nausea/vomiting from it - it’s like my body forgot how to eat even though it desperately needs healthy food to recover from major unrelated surgery."
Lack of Hunger?,"I recently noticed that I have been eating much less then what I should be. Not necessarily because I am restricting, but more so because I'm not hungry, or nothing sounds appealing. Due to how self conscious I have been lately, I am mildly concerned that I may be falling back into bad habits, just subconsciously restricting rather then purposefully. I have tried to eat the portions I know are right rather then just what I am hungry for, but it makes me physically feel as if I, well, am eating too much. I'm wondering, are my concerns a possibility? And what can I do to get back to eating 'normal'?"
Anyone on here who had long term anorexia feel weary about pregnancy?,"Forgive me if this post is too specific but for those who had anorexia from adolescence into their 20s, how do you feel about having a child? 

I’m going on 29, but have only been in recovery for a solid 2 years now and have only started to actually start establishing my life. It’s scary because much like anyone who had this disorder, I was robbed of living for 12 years. No life at all throughout my late adolescence and early twenties because my days revolved strictly around isolation and starving myself. 

I know my biological clock is ticking but after so much time not fully living, it just seems like I don’t need to have a child within the next 5 years because I need to find my place in the world first 🤣

Also I’m convinced any drastic changes in my body once again would potentially trigger my ED again. Idk. Anyone feel the same?"
Globus sensation after anorexia,"Ever since I hit my lowest weight when i had a globus sensation in my throat, I have gained a decent amount of weight back and I still have it, can anorexia cause a globus sensation and has anyone else here experienced it."
Doctors appointment,"
I (16f) had a doctors appointment yesterday. For the past few weeks I’ve been having a little relapse and I definitely lost some weight so I was a little nervous to go. I got there and they weighed me. I lost 4 pounds. Once I got to meet with my actual doctor, she said she wasn’t concerned about the weight loss since I had over shot my weight a little bit. I knew damn well that the weight I had lost is not healthy because I’ve been getting dizzy when I stand up, I’ve been cold and I’ve been acting on the ED thoughts. (My original goal weight was 12 pounds heavier then what I weight now) My dad usually meets with the doctor with me. My doctor talks about me with my dad like I’m not even there. She also said that since I’m cleared as weight restored, there’s nothing else she can do until we hear back from the ed program. (It’s a 2 year wait list) I guess this is just a little vent about how fucked up the system is."
"I know recovery is not linear, but that’s not fair","I know it’s what everybody says, recovery is not linear, but this is so frustrating. I was doing so good for the past like month and a half, my anxiety was lower, I was eating whatever I wanted and just happy and living my life and then all the sudden I had a few days of unplanned going out and getting drinks, and since then every single thing has been so difficult. I am so frustrated!!"
Eating *After* EH Episode? Following Meal Plan vs. Honoring Hunger? Men in Anorexia Recovery?,"I feel like my hunger (and hormones) are all over the place at the moment. I've been having about one ""EH episode"" a day for the past few weeks (if not months!) now....they're incredibly disconcerting/exhausting/depressing, but I'm trying to remember that this is a normal part of recovery. I could really use some guidance/support, and would love folks' thoughts on the following questions: 

1) do you think it's still important to follow a ""meal plan"" of some sorts, and eat in the absence of hunger, following one of these EH episodes? For instance, I finished one of these episodes around 6pm today, and I can't imagine I'll be very hungry this evening. But I also imagine that it's important for me to still eat something, even in the absence of hunger, if only to continue to reassure my body that food is abundant? I feel like my body still doesn't trust that regular amounts of food will come in, even though I have been gaining a significant amount weight and am on a good trajectory (though I am still underweight for sure)....I just want my hunger and fullness cues to normalize again! (I recognize this may not happen until I am at my set point weight). Also, what do folks think about ""urge surfing"" during these episodes (which more or less feels impossible when I'm ""overtaken"" my mental hunger)....e.g, trying to get my body to trust that I \*will\* sufficiently nourish it later in the day, and that it is not necessary to consume everything in sight right at this very moment? and that I'll feel better if I space the calories out vs. consuming an extremely large amount in one sitting? I guess I'm wondering how much people recommend ""surrendering"" to the EH, whenever it hits, vs. trying to ""abide by"" a more sustainable plan that has me nourishing myself in appropriate amounts at particular intervals throughout the day. 

2) I know one marker of recovery for female-identifying folks is the restoration of their period. what would you consider an equivalent for male-identifying people? I'm definitely noticing that I'm ""hornier"" than I was during my anorexic time period (when my libido was  non-existent), but I'm certainly not consistently waking up with morning wood as I was in high school/college or anywhere near as libidinous as I was during those times. I feel like ""spontaneous erections"" (lol – I know this is ridiculous, but it's also sad that I see virtually no online discourse about this topic!) might be a good marker, but am wondering what other people think. I trust my libido will continue to improve with nutritional restoration, but in the meantime, any thoughts are appreciated. Free/Total Testosterone levels is something else I've been thinking about....

For those who are recovered/on their way to being recovered: when/if do you stop feeling so cold?,"i am constantly cold.

like a “to the bone” cold. it’s honestly a joke at this point. it is mid summer and i’m still freezing.

it was never like this pre-ED and i guess im wondering if i’ll ever feel properly warm again or if i’ll have to live in hoodies and blankets forever :/

would also like to ask if anyone has any tips or suggestions for me 💛"
How long does it take to recover?,"Sorry if it’s a stupid question, I just read from my study materials that it takes average 6 years to recover from anorexia. Does it mean that the psychological symptoms get better after 6years? 

I just feel like a fraud, I was weight restored like two months into the recovery so I wouldn’t meet the criteria for AN anymore even tho I still struggle mentally. 

Are people underweight and experiencing physical symptoms for 6years or does it mean it takes that long for the psychological symptoms to go away?"
DAE feel hunger in their throat instead of stomach,"When i get hungry i feel it in my throat, it feels like a pressure is near my adam's apple and it causes me to want to swallow every 10 or so seconds and sipping on water or tea makes it go away temporarily, it also causes saliva to build up in my mouth. i don't know if it is actual hunger though as it happens when i am not even mentally hungry. And usually i don't feel hunger in my actual stomach either. So if it is not hunger idk what it could be, i never had it prior to having an eating disorder though."
What do I do if it gets bad again?,After a whole year of fighting I relapsed about 5 days ago and I am now closer to my original low weight than to my weight that I fought so hard for. I am so down. I just want to be normal weight and not have to worry about all of this. I had a lot of anxiety and stress which led to me not eating. I don’t know what to do. Now the initial stress is gone but there comes again the stress of being extremely underweight and having to go through all of this again. Anytime I see food I get so nauseous and every single cell in my body refuses to eat. What do I do now?
finally uninstalled calorie counter!!,its been the biggest thing holding me back in recovery :')) here's to it being gone and (hopefully!!) staying gone!!
Waking up at the exact same time every night hungry to eat,"Ever since I started recovery I have been waking up at exactly 3:00am on the dot every single morning with mental hunger wanting to eat. Is it normal for it to be an exact time that I wake up, it feels like my body is being programmed to want to eat at night."
How to successfully recover from muscle loss/atrophy?,"Hi everyone. So I’ve been struggling with a sort of mild anorexia ever since I got major surgery two years ago. Due to having to be on an extended liquid diet for two months during this recovery from surgery I had unintentionally dropped down to a concerning weight, but haven’t been able to gain much of any of my previous weight back since. It’s only been very recently that I’m starting to get to a bit of a more healthy weight.

But despite this one of my biggest concerns is that I think the weight I lost has caused my muscles to atrophy quite significantly, because I struggle to be on my feet or do any physical activity for very long without feeling faint and wobbly. This has affected my ability to do a so many things I feel like I should be able to do that other people my age are doing with relative ease. These days I eat a pretty healthy diet with adequate nutrition so I assumed it wasn’t an issue with energy or the like, but it feels like my muscles are just very very weak. 

My question is has anyone been able to successfully recover their muscle loss? What do you suggest I can do to regain it? because most exercises feel too hard for me to complete, Is there good way to slowly regain muscle for someone who has almost virtually no muscle mass? Thank you!!!"
How to deal with rude comments during recovery,Do you guys have any tips on dealing with rude comments from people. Whenever I hear them it just makes me want to go back into the anorexia. Thank you in advance!
Why that much now?,"Before real recovery, I could eat less that 2000 calories and don't think about more. Now, I constantly thinking about more and can't ""fill"" myself. Why that so?"
"Recovered, period back, infertile possibility?","Hi, I'm in early 20s, I was anorexic for 8 months (2018-2019) and was missing my period for the last 5 months of the 8. After a month of treatment, I got my period back and gained weight at normal BMI. I did go through BED after and gained more weight for a few months but my period has never been missing since then. I recovered from BED in June 2020 and now I'm recovered fully from both disorders. 

Time to time I wonder if those 5 months of missing periods could have made me infertile.. Anyone have similar experiences? I didn't track ovulation during those 5 months. I have normal, 90% regular periods now. I can't confirm infertility unless I get pregnant or something I guess.

Sorry if this has been asked before, I didn't want to go through the subreddit to avoid potential triggers."

(POSSIBLE TW?) How to not get nauseus when eating?,"Whenever I think about eating I just get nauseus which makes me not want to eat even more. I haven't eaten much these last few days, and when I do I can only eat so much before I get nauseus again, even though I'm not full.  I'm tired of being tired all the time, I know it's because I don't eat enough but I don't get hungry very often anymore and nothing seems appetizing enough to eat when I'm not hungry for it.  Is there a trick to eating when you don't feel like it, or is it more like something I'll have to train myself to do?"
"Are energy ups and downs normal in recovery? TW: Weight, BMI","i have been doing all in recovery for about 3-4 weeks now, i have gained 6kg and some days i feel a lot better already, more energy, happier etc. However on other days i feel just as bad as when i was restriction and feel like doing nothing except eat and watch yt or sleep. Is this normal? 

I have also had blood tests done and everything is in the normal range

I am a 15 year old male

I am 5 foot 10 and i started at 54.5kg and now weight 60.8kg as of this morning. My BMI is now considered in the low end of the healthy weight range but before i started restricting i was 68kg so i think my set point weight is in the middle of the healthy weight range not at the bottom."

help - extreme hunger driving me insane,"this is the second time this month i’ve honoured my extreme hunger. last sunday i ate around 4000 cals, and today i ate over 4000 again. i don’t even feel sick or anything, i’m just hungry. i could probably eat more to be honest. it feels so wrong honouring my hunger, honouring my cravings, and listening to my body. i just feel like ive made a huge mistake. i know i’m underweight and need to gain, i know i hate having anorexia, but god damn i feel crazy being this hungry.
if anyone has any words of wisdom or advice i’d appreciate it a lot."
Does pacing back and forth inhibit recovery?,"After I eat I find myself constantly pacing up and down for a couple of hours. I usually stop when my legs get very sore, but I notice I’m able to keep this going for a while. I know movement in general burns calories but I’m wondering if this pacing thing is preventing me from recovering to a healthy weight."
"sudden weighr dropping, is this actual weight?","when i went to my therapist for my last appointment, my weighr had dropped to 107 pounds, compared to 109 pounds the day before. i weighed myself for the next 2 days & the scale was saying i dropped to 103 pounds. is this actual weighr or? i’ve lost 10 pounds over the summer & i feel like i can see a different shape to my face, but i don’t know if this is actual weighr"
Family based therapy (fbt),"I’ve been in recovery for a few months now. As mentioned in the title I’m doing fbt. I really just don’t understand how this is supposed to help me. At the beginning, the only thing we focused on was increasing my intake since I was underweight. Now that I’m at a healthy weight my meal plan has been switched to a maintenance meal plan. My parents are slowly giving me back the freedom of eating alone. What I don’t understand is how I’m supposed to be any better then a few months ago. My thoughts are all the same, I avoid my fear foods, I skip meals whenever I can. We haven’t done anything to fix those behaviours. If anything they’re worse since I’m in a bigger body now. If anyone have any advice or personal experiences to share that would be appreciated."
first week of recovery,"i’m nearing the end of my first week since committing to recovery, and am in some of the worst stomach pain i’ve ever been in my life…

for the past few days, i’ve been honoring both my mental and physical hunger as best i could while significantly reducing my exercise and sticking to a consistent eating pattern while ignoring all temptations to restrict or compensate for the sudden increased intake of calories. i will admit that rather than being gradual, the shift was quite sudden due to extreme hunger that kicked in a couple days ago, and probably a huge shock for my body. i’ve dealt with some pretty painful bloating at the end of each day, but never anything as bad as what i’m going through right now… 

it’s been over four hours since i last ate, but my stomach’s still painfully distended and it quite literally feels (and looks) like i’m carrying an impregnated watermelon inside of me. i occasionally feel like i’m going to involuntarily throw up. no amount of massaging, gentle walking, lying, or heat packs has helped. the thing is, i didn’t even eat as much today compared to yesterday… 

can anyone speak on their experience with the physical part of active recovery? is this normal, or should i go to a physician to see if there might be another cause? does it (the bloat, the digestive issues, etc.) eventually get better? 

side note: if anyone has any food recommendations that might lessen or avoid causing bloating, i’d really appreciate it! 

another question: i’ve been consuming an absurd amount of food and sugar each day due to eh. i would say i’ve had about 5 eh days so far, where the majority of my absolutely ginormous caloric intake were things like ice cream, cookies, etc. as a result, my weight has shot up way faster than i thought was possible in the past few days alone. how much of this might be the bloat and water weight, and how much might be actual fat accumulation? i find it hard to believe that it’s just bloating and water, because the amount of sugar and calories i’ve eaten in a matter of days is ridiculously sky high. 

sorry this turned into a mini rant… i’m just in so much physical (and mental) agony rn :("
I finally ate something again,After a few days of extreme stress and not being able to eat because of it I finally just ate a small portion of porridge to get my stomach used to food again. I am optimistic that in a few days I will be able to eat my normal portions again. 👍👍
Is my period coming back?,"Hey everyone! Quick back story - restricted between April and June and exercised compulsively from March until July, haven’t had a period since March. In recovery now but only put on 1lb in a month, feeling healthier overall already though. I’m getting some familiar symptoms I haven’t had since March and I’m just wondering if this means my period is coming? 

• discharge (I haven’t really had any discharge at all the past few months and this discharge is very similar to what I would get before menstruation)
• headaches and backaches
• cramps (definitely not intestinal, this feels very much ovary based!)
• my body temperature is no longer too cold or too hot, feels very normal?
• only really want sweet food

Thoughts? As a disclaimer, I have only ever been a few pounds underweight (if you are going by BMI) at most and my dietician/doctor think my recovery should be fairly quick due to the short period of restriction and the fact my caloric intake was >!1,300!< overall for it, only going to >!1,200!< for one week and would frequently have cheat days of >!1,800!< and over.

Thanks!"

my family friend's photo of me eating ice cream triggers me,"Hi, reddit. This is my first reddit lost.

I labeled this NSFW because there's small mentions of my (kind of) past anorexia. 

I (17f) am trying to recover from anorexia. About 3 months ago, I was visiting my brother (35m), and his friend who considers himself to my brother, too (26m) has this thing where he takes photos of people to make funny stickers on whatsapp.

The whole time I was visiting my brother and his wife (37f), which was 4 months, they were calling me ugly, so I feel like I can't trust them. When I told them that I had anorexia, they (expecially my SIL) started calling me fat and making fun of me. 

Sometime in that, my brother's friend took a candid photo of me eating ice cream. I tried to be okay for so long, but it kills me on the inside. 

(TW: insecurity and *norexic thoughts)

I feel so hurt knowing that people have photos of me eating ice cream. It triggers my anorexia, and remembering that they have a photo of me eating ice cream makes me want to go back to everything im trying to leave.

(*norexic thoughts over)

What should I do? I feel like the photos of me eating ice cream are prohibiting me from receiving properly.

New girlfriend with eating problems,"
I’ve been in recovery for a few months now but I’m easily triggered and have relapsed many times. I’ve just started dating this girl and she hardly eats anything. She came over yesterday and only had a small bag of crackers. I had a sandwich and a few other things. She is very thin and the fact that she dosent eat much really triggers me. She knows I have an Ed, I’ve been very open about it. I don’t know what to do? Do I bring up the possibility of her also possibly having an Ed? I don’t want to break up with her because of this."

Spider Veins,"Hi guys,
A little background for my questions:

I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in 2016. I've had treatment since then with relapses and never reached full recovery or a recovered weight. Fast forward to now. For about 10 months I've been working with a great nutritionist who has gotten me eating a hefty number of cals. (I won't mention in case it triggers someone.) I'm as close to stable (goal?) Weight as I've ever been.

I also have a history of over exercise. At the worst I was walking 11 to 13 miles per day. I am now walking 6.25 miles a day. Down from 8.25 on 01/01/2023
I've had high AST and ALT levels for a year and saw a liver Dr last week for blood work and a scan. My anxiety self is freaking out about this. I've also had edema around my legs and feet this late into recovery. I noticed what may be spider veins develop after a month or so after the last bout of edema. Now I'm freaking out about that too. I'm looking at all the veins in my legs and trying to decide if I'm pale or have other issues in addition to AN. 

I've read Sick Enough by Dr. Guliani so the AST ALT levels I half expect,but the rest freaks me out.

The Questions:
Has anyone had what could be spider veins and liver issues ? 
Where the spider veins a vein disease or did you have problems after recovery?
Did your liver issues resolve with recovery?

Any insight would be appreciated."
Workouts during HA recovery,How much and often should I be working out during HA recovery? From what I understand doing lots of low impact workouts is safe but I don’t want to lose progress and get weaker either.
went out to eat!!,Just went out to eat and didn’t order a salad for the first time in a while!! I literally just had the best burger I’ve ever ate right now. I feel so physically uncomfortable because I shared dessert afterwards but I’m pretty happy overall with today.
My period is gone,"My period is gone
My treatment for this is not yet complete. 
My dietitian gave me weight suggestions to be healthy. I still have some way to go, but there is something that scares me a little. 
Do I need to go above the weight recommended by my dietitian to bring my period back?
On tiktok there's lot of videos about it and it really made me confused

When I reach the recommended weight, I will apply to the obstetrician, but I still wanted to ask.

Thank you for the answers"

Is it usual to not eat 3 meals a day but still eat enough,"Hey I’m weight restored now and to get here I would eat breakfast lunch dinner and 3 snacks. Now I’m wondering if it’s usual to just eat, but not like rigid or set meals idk how to explain. Like for example today I woke up too late so I had a big breakfast and no lunch except i snacked on a few things until dinner then I had dessert. It was still enough but wasn’t exactly 3 meals 3 snacks. Idk if this makes sense"
I really need help,I totally relapsed. I had extreme stress for the last two days and two more extreme stressful days are about to follow. I haven’t eaten for the last two days and I can’t. Whenever I even see food I feel sick to my stomach and when I have it in my mouth all my body wants to do is spit it out. I want to eat.

Festivals are gonna be the end of me 🥴,"I've managed to fit 4 ice creams, a portion of Dutch mini pancakes with nutella, a huge hotdog, large fries an iced mocha, half a bigass cherry strudel and a frappe into my stomach all in one afternoon (I had lunch and breakfast before this too)

What are your opinions/experiences with antidepressants??,I am thinking of going on antidepressants because I have so bad anxiety which also caused my anorexia and at this point I want to try it out and see if it‘ll get easier and maybe I can live my life normally again. So if any of you ever taken them did it help with your anorexia? Has it affected your relationships or has your personality changed in any way or form? Would you recommend it??
What type of medical professional do I need to walk me through EDNOS recovery?,"Because I've cycled between binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia over the course of the last 15 years and I'm fucking exhausted. ""Recovering"" on my own from my last anorexia stint sent me into a torturous binge/restrict/purge cycle over the past year and I'm at my wits end. Don't know if the normal anorexia recovery eating suggestions apply to me since I also suffer from binge eating and emotional eating. I know I need help because my life is in shatters because of this, but I have no clue who to seek out.. I've tried psychiatrist and therapists so far and with no luck. Do I need a dietician?? Or a specific type of therapist?? Idk, I'm so confused."
Period is back!,"My cycle is very irregular and it’s been a while since I had it, but I am so relieved that it came back! (So maybe I can get better?!!) 😊"

It’s hard when it’s easy and it’s hard when it’s hard,"I’m so frustrated. I was doing really well in my recovery, things were going really good, and at the time I felt bad because of that… Like I felt guilty because it “shouldn’t be this easy” and I felt like I was a fraud and I wasn’t really sick or anything, and then we went for a weekend away, I ate a lot, felt guilty, and all of a sudden everything is really hard again. My brain is screaming at me all the time and it’s beyond frustrating. It was easy, and it was hard because it was easy, but now it is just hard all around. Is it ever just going to be easy and good?"
"back from a 3 day field trip, feeling guilty","i feel so guilty about what i ate these past days. ive had so many sweets and things deemed ""unhealthy"" (much more than i would normally) and rven though i know i moved around a lot and probably burned a lot of energy, im guilty.

it also doesnt help that i have pretty bad ""food dysmorphia"" (a term i created to represent thinking and feeling like im eating a gigantic amount of food / that im eating much more than people around me) and i know that different bodies have different needs and stuff - but i CANT GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD. 

i want real badly to attempt to count my cals to ""assure me"" i ate ""normally"", but i know that'll just make me more susceptible to the ED voice. 

edit: something that makes me feel really nervous is the breakfast part. i always thought i had realtively small breakfeasts, but for two days i ate more than my other friends at that meal AND had more snacks (in the morning and afternoon on all days)

i know i shouldnt, but im scared this will make me gain weight. ive been trying to look at weight gain as something good, and it has been - but im already weight restored and scared ill gain an insane amount. i actually havent noticed any weight gain, but i know it doesnt happen overnight, and im scared ill eat a bunch more than usual these next days too... i just dont know, and i dont know what sort of comments would make me feel better either, but any support is appreciated - really"
how to deal with unintentional weight gain after weight restoration?,"im fully weight restored and decided to go on the scale and saw i gained about 1.5 lbs since i last weighed myself, which was like 2 weeks ago. i havent been able to stop thinking about it since and i keep overthinking abt what caused it. due to this, ive been hyper aware of what im eating and have increased my exercise n movement. im not relapsing or have any desire to, just urges to go back down to my weight before and take control to avoid gaining more. i just have this huge fear that weight will ""crawl back to me"" and ill become overweight before i know it. just the thought of it makes me wanna cry... idk what to do and i feel so much guilt when i eat dessert now, even tho thats something i do almost every day. i dont know how to feel ok with it, since the weight gain was unintentional and i just think i must have been doing things ""wrong"" and eating badly, otherwise how else wld i gain weight? :("
having an off week. when does it get better??,I only suffered from an ED for three months but I feel like mentally I’m having such a hard time recovering. I’m weight restored…gaining rapidly and I’m back to my normal weight before restricting and working out every day. but my mind is always in food. am i hungry? am i not hungry? will i keep gaining so much since i’m weight restored after a month and a half (gained 10 pounds since recovering two monhs ago went all in). i don’t feel confident…i’m scared…anxious…i overthink everything involving my body and food and i just want it all to stop and no one understands. more than anything I want to be healthy so I keep eating without restrictinf and usually three meals with snacks in between. but i’m so scared since I gained so quickly in such little time back to my regular weight. i’m tired of all the overthinking. i need advice i guess and support
Am I eating enough?,"Hello hello! I’m about 1.5 months into attempting recovery and about 2.5 weeks into EH (though it has tapered off a lot now). I have a meal plan and I’m starting to feel like I’m eating like a “normal” human but can feel myself slipping slightly into restrictive behaviours. I just wanted to see if you all think I’m eating enough? I’m starting to get my hunger/fullness signals come back (intermittently though, not always reliable) - never been so happy to hear my stomach rumble! Here is what I have eaten today, all pretty normal portion sizes, teetering slightly on small portions. I haven’t included calories because I don’t know them but I’m sure you can roughly calculate if you want! I’m also vegan, just to add for informational purposes.

9:00am breakfast: 2 x slices toast with peanut butter

11:15am AM snack: banana and oat milk latte

2:15pm lunch: pizza express vegan leggera pizza (the one with a hole/salad in the middle!) and a Diet Coke

4:30pm PM snack: M&S peanut and choc bar and iced oat latte

5:30pm PM snack part 2: apple, 2 x Medjool dates and cup of tea with oat milk

7:30pm dinner: peanut butter and veg fried rice

8:45pm dessert: blackberries, strawberries, satsuma, dark choc and 1 hobnob

9:30pm before bed: 1 x digestion tea and 1 x glutamine/psyllium husk drink

2-3 litres of water.

My EH was far more extreme to begin with and I have no specific cravings (other than fresh fruit!) now to add on too. Thanks!"
Vegan recovery foods,"I have been trying so hard to recover but I just change seem to put on weight. I eat a lot of ready to go frozen foods, but last night for example I had 5 vegan chicken fingers and it’s only 250 cals. I am trying to eat and eat but it seems hard with vegan food and I am at a breaking point. I eat the same foods day in and day out because options are so limited and I am so sick of this. 

I want to recover. I want to look healthy. 

Any recommendations on foods that would be good?"
Don't always believe your scale,"Yesterday I made the mistake of weighing myself and it shocked me so much. I gained 10kg in less than 2 months and I'm almost weight restored. Today I couldn't help but step on the scale again, just to check and I was 2 kg heavier. That made me almost skip breakfast and think about if I should really have 3 snacks and if I should go back to counting calories and eliminating carbs and fat and what not. I still had my slice of cake for breakfast though, just to ensure that my thoughts stay thoughts, and then I decided to step on the scale again. And, with a full stomach, I dropped 3kg again. I turned the scale around and it's broken🤦🏻‍♀️one of the sensors or whatever on the back fell off and now I feel dumb for almost going back to my old habits just because of a silly number."
Overweight,"So I began recovery about 5 months ago, and I have gained 40 pounds. I was underweight, and now I’m overweight. I knew I was gonna gain in recovery but OVERWEIGHT?? Like I was underweight 5 months ago. Keep in mind I’m 5”1 so 40 pounds is a big amount. I have been working out occasionally but idk what to do. I am trying so hard not to relapse but I don’t want to be overweight forever. Even not eating disorder related, being overweight is not healthy and I’ve never been overwight in my life. Did this happen to anyone or does anyone have insight about my massive weight gain? I just feel so unhealthy trying to be healthy :( I appreciate any comments at all just hoping for support"
really hard to not obsess after weight restoration,"as i spend more time weight restored it is harder and harder for me not to obsess about how many calories i eat for a meal or for the day (doing my best not to count these days but sometimes i struggle). it's especially difficult on low activity days, typically my days off from work. there's a huge fear that i'll keep gaining and gaining, or that my portion sizes will continue to increase. it was so much easier when i was still weight restoring. my meals are often a bonkers amount of calories, and now i have 3 meals plus 2-3 snacks and it just... feels like too much. my body may need to be at a higher weight for a while, and/or need more energy to facilitate repairs, but hot damn feeling like i'm not in control is a nightmare. it's scary that it often takes so much food to feel physically satisfied, and that sometimes i'll eat what seems like a large and balanced meal (that even my dietician would approve of) and be hungry again an hour later. 

would love to hear things that helped people who started to get even more stressed about how much they ate post-weight restoration."
Eating for Joy,"Nutrition is important. So is happiness. There is no rule that says we cannot have both

Today I nourished my body with a wholesome healthy sandwich and whole grain bread and nut butter to feed my body’s growth.

Then I had fruit and yogurt and granola to feed the gut and give me some of that wonderful, wonderful energy

Then my dorm-mate brought back some delicious candies from the zoo and made some rich lasagna. I ate that too and it tasted SO GOOD

Tonight my stomach feels so happy and healthy and FULL

This is great"
"Weight restored , now what?","I am finally wait restored, which I’m really glad about, but now I am terrified. I am still sticking to my meal plan, and honoring my hunger, but I am scared I’m just going to keep gaining forever. A long time ago I used a tdee calorie calculator and since I’m very short and not very active with my job, it told me that I needed a lot fewer calories that I’m eating on a daily basis and eating that few has never come naturally to me and would require restriction. I don’t know how accurate those online calculators are, but now I’m panicking thinking that either I restrict, or I will forever gain weight until I am physically unhealthy. It’s not even aesthetics that are worrying me, it’s just for my health!"
gaining 10 lbs in two months after recovering,I very briefly suffered from a restrictive ED where I under ate and worked out everyday for like three months. I went all in when recovering and i noticed i quickly went back to my “regular” weight which was 10lbs more than i weighted in my ED. Is it normal to gain  weight this rapidly? especially when not working our or restricting? I’m sticking to three meals with snacks in between
How to get period back?,"When I first started restricting and over-exercising I immediately lost my period. For almost a month I’ve been eating more than 1,000 calories and for this last week or two I’ve been eating probably around 1,400? I lost my period around early January and now that I’ve been busy with school these last two weeks, I’ve hardly had time to exercise but I do walk more than before. By BMI standards I am also not under weight. How long will it take me to get back my period? 
Ps. My TDEE is about 1,400 so I am eating enough."
Period loss,"When I restore my period, will that mean I’d be able to have kids? Or does losing it destroy any hope of that regardless of if I get it back? Women in my family already struggle with pregnancy, and I’m deeply concerned I just destroyed my future family."
extreme hunger is making me suicidal,"basically what it says in the time. i started trying to recover about 2 months ago and started an outpatient programme a month ago. the past week or so, its suddenly hit really bad. i have to assume its extreme hunger, but it honestly feels like im just bingeing. i know, i know, ""there's no real 'bingeing' in recovery"", but knowing that doesn't help me feel any less terrified and disgusted. every night i come home from work and its like i cant get to sleep until ive eaten 3-5 of the most disgustingly overloaded mug cakes the world has ever seen, and i wake up sick to my core and cant stop myself from trying to restrict again. i KNOW restricting makes it worse, i KNOW fighting it makes it worse, but i feel so gross and ashamed that i cant bring myself to do anything else. it feels like im broken and i hate it, and i dont know how much longer i can take it. my next outpatient appointment is tomorrow and i plan on bringing it up then, but my self-esteem right now is at fucking rock bottom. if it doesnt end soon, im terrified ill end up doing something drastic. i know its ridiculous, i know this thought process is unhealthy and that im letting the disorder win, but i really starting to think im not strong enough to get through this."
Scared of exercise?,"I feel afraid of exercise because I scared of need to eat more that I have planned before. How to get rid of this way of thinking? Also, this add additional stress, cause I scared of gaining ""too"" much that more streamlined progress because of lack of exercise. This sound like a paradox."
Made cookies today!,"Today I made cookies, ate a metric ton of raw cookie dough. Usually when I do this, I guilt myself into not eating the finished result, but this time, I had a cookie, and it was fantastic!"
"I’ve had anorexia since I was 10 years old, but I’ve been in recovery since I was 21.","I’m 23 now. There’s so much change in my body but it’s all stuff no one would really think about. Here’s some of my recovery wins. 

My hair actually grows. 

I get hunger signals sometimes, they’re not always present, but I get them sometimes. I used to never get hungry. 

My skin looks less dull. 

If I work out, I can actually maintain the muscle mass. 

I continued growing taller. My doctor had told me I would stop growing at 5’7, but because I put the work in, I’m now closer to 5’11. 

I don’t feel dizzy all the time anymore. 

I feel less agitated and less tired. 

I don’t have that dying organ smell I used to have. 

I can wear a swimsuit now and go swimming, which is something I love. 

I don’t look at my body in disgust anymore. 

My weight has gone from severely underweight to a more normal level. 

Random strangers don’t walk up to me to tell me to eat something anymore."
Should I tell close friends about recovery?,"I'm just starting recovery and I don't know if it'd be beneficial to tell my close friends about it. To my knowledge, none of them have had this experience but I still think they might be able to help somehow. Am I right to think that it would help and is there anything I should be worried about? Thanks for any suggestions!"
My mind wants me to eat but my body refuses,"I’m so glad that I have mentally reached the stage where I am now wanting to eat and actively craving food but my body is completely against me. Anytime I try to eat, my stomach clenches, my throat closes and all my physical symptoms come back. I’m so frustrated and tired; I’ve worked so hard to mentally be better and physically I just can’t do it"
I can’t do this!!,"Recovery was going so well until I became weight restored. Now everything just feels so much harder. My head keeps screaming at me. “Don’t eat that, you shouldn’t gain any more weight, you are already weight restored” and it’s so hard! I’m working on intuitive eating with my dietitian now but i feel like I can’t keep going! 

Things go well until I have a weekend away or a night out or something like that. I have a party this weekend and I know I’ll be drinking alcohol and my head is panicking out about those calories! Plus I can eat so much when I’m drunk, like I must eat 2/3x my daily intake on days out and I’m absolutely freaking out about that! I feel like crying just thinking about it! 😭😭

Logically, I know weight is unimportant and there is nothing wrong with gaining it, but I can’t make myself believe that for myself."
how to make sure youre eating enough,"i dont have a perception of “normal” amount of food, so I’m constantly not eating enough. ive considered counting calories but idk if that will trigger me"
Wanting to relapse,I want to relapse really bad. I’m only one month into recovery and have gained back some weight quickly and I hate my body so much. It’s all I think about. I want to look smaller again and I really want to restrict again. But I’m so hungry lately that I don’t even know if I’d be able to. I just am so self critical. The shorts I bought at my sickest don’t fit anymore and it’s absolutely bashing me. I hate this.
Mom adding double cream to my food,I’m weight restored and slowly getting better but my mom added double cream to my food thinking I wouldn’t notice and it’s weirding me out. She always does stuff like this with other people like with my dad she would purposefully get the more fattening food and tell me she was trying to make him fat. I’m not trying to be disordered but this is really breaking my trust in her especially since I’m already weight restored and don’t really need to gain more weight nor honestly do I want to. What do I do?
I want to gain weight but don't know how to,"I have been diagnosed with anorexia for years now and i want to gain more weight but I don't know how to. I've done certain diets, exercises and certain foods (oats, peanut butter, meat...) and I'm only able to gain fat in my stomach. Does anyone have any suggestions? 😭"
Nervous for dinner,"Anxiety building because my dad is making bbq baby back ribs for dinner and I happen to know the calories. Is it possible to gain weight directly from this meal? Please post encouragement, I’m spiraling."
Is it possible that Anorexia lowered my set point weight?,"I have been gaining weight rapidly but recently stalled. No matter how I eat and I try to eat un-restrictively. That is, no meal plan and eating whatever I crave. I have not eaten a salad in the past 3 months and I am finding myself in disbelief that I am able to actually eat this much and not really gaining too much weight. It is like living my old anorexic dream. I am still underweight, but I do not have the anorexic look anymore. I am not sure how to get back to my pre ED weight though..... any thoughts or similar experiences? However, I do notice that I do get hungry very easily compared to normal people. "
Struggling,"Really really struggling. I have such severe anxiety of my extreme hunger. I’m just over two weeks into it, it does feel like it’s far less intense now (gone from a 10/10 intensity to a 4/10) and I have no specific cravings anymore - nothing actually sounds good to me. I’m just so scared of the hunger. It’s not the weight gain I’m scared of, I can come to terms with that. It’s just the fact I’m NEVER satisfied and I don’t know when the next hunger will come on. I’m genuinely petrified and it’s causing me such distress. I’m so scared to leave the house or do anything at all. I wake up praying it’s over and feel deep grief when it’s not, this just feels like a living nightmare. Please give me tips on how to get through this? I do feel like it’s *starting* to taper off a bit but I’m just so intensely fearful. It’s causing me panic attacks daily! I restricted for 12/13 weeks, didn’t lose a huge amount of weight and plateaued for the last 7 weeks so I am hopeful the damage won’t take too long to reverse. Please can someone reassure me? Thank you"
I want to get healthy but don't know how,"I would like to get healthy. I am 20 years old and have had a problem with food since I was 14. In the meantime it has become so bad that I don't want to keep any food inside me and I vomit everything, I have to weigh myself after every meal  drink to make sure I haven't gained weight.... I would like to get better, but unfortunately my attempts to tell others are useless. If I eat with someone who knows about my problem, I can relax and eat without a guilty conscience. Otherwise I have to vomit. Unfortunately I live alone. My boyfriend does not want a girlfriend with a mental problem, so he does not know. However, he is the one who often triggers me and that although I have already lost a lot of weight. He is really obsessed with my weight. My therapy is not getting me anywhere and a clinic is out of the question since I am in law school.
I have already broken blood and parts of my stomach I think? My esophagus is inflamed and the psychological pressure is increasing..
I was a competitive athlete and know how much sport can help, yet the routine does nothing for me because I slip again. Does anyone have any ideas? I don't want to ruin myself & my health... I really want to get better on my own."
i feel like i’ve been a faker,i know i’m eating enough calories for my body weight but i just can’t stop eating after dinner and in between meals. it’s mostly sugary foods. but the issue is that it’s so easy for me to scarf down sweets and not feel bad about it until i see the scale go up. me 2 weeks ago wouldn’t even touch anything sweet but now it’s kind of a shock because it’s so easy for me to keep eating.
TW: I had a set back,"I’ve been doing so well. I’ve been focusing on 3 meals/3 snacks to the best of my ability. But I’ve slipped up. Twice. Once that my DH knows about. 
Last night I had a friend over. And we were having wine/cheese/crackers. That’s have been fine but I’d had half a subway before I picked her up. An hour after she came over my stomach started hurting and I went and purged. 
No one said anything our husbands got here about 15 minutes later but they’d been out all day. 
Tonight the choice for dinner was mine. I picked spag bol. It’s one of my favourites. I didn’t eat much. I had to put it down. And I went upstairs and purged. I’ve been doing so well at not doing that. It’s been weeks. DH walked into the bathroom with me over the toilet and started screaming at me that I’m a liar and a failure. 

He won’t talk to me now. He said I’m being a teenager and I need to grow up. That I’m failing my daughter by being a terrible example to her. (All things I know already - he doesn’t need to scream it at me). 

I deserve this. 

I feel like a total piece of shit and have no one to reach out to. Not anyone I can explain this to at least. 

Does anyone have any kind or supportive words?"
Affirmations,What are some affirmations/things you remind yourself of that help you through recovery?
New here and have lost a massive amount of weight from GI issues and now I developed an eating disorder I think? I’m scared please help.,"Long story short, I got violently sick randomly six months ago. Found out I have something called SMA syndrome , it’s a vascular gastro issue. I was always 5”4 120 pounds my whole life, fit healthy muscular, you name it.  well this sickness effects how you can eat which means I get full VERY VERY fast and if I force myself to eat anything more it comes right back up involuntarily. I am now 95 pounds. My bones are poking out of my body and I can feel and see everything. My hips hurt, I can’t even sit down because my butt is gone and I feel my bones crushing against the chair. I’m so weak and sick and tired and I look like hell! I’m so absolutely terrified that I’m going to end up hospitalized. I have been eating as much as I possible can and counting cals to make sure I’m eating enough rn to at least maintain and I’m still losing weight with barley any physical activity. Any tips and advice until I can stretch my stomach to eat in a surplus?? I literally cannot eat more than a few bites without being full and my doctor is starting to think it’s mental and I believe it’s mental too. Anything helps!"
Need advice,"Hi! I've been wanting to ask:
Should I wait out and listen for my body's hunger cues to kick in or should I force feed it when I'm below my calorie needs for the day? I often feel full after eating not so much and it makes me feel as if I'm binging just to meet my calorie needs... Any advice?"
i want to relapse,"i am having a very hard time with my weight. i haven’t weighed myself since hitting a specific number because i knew i’d spiral if i kept going over that. i know that i’ve gained since then, i can see it in the mirror and i can feel it on my body. i feel disgusting if i’m honest. i know it’s unhelpful to frame the gain as this and i’ve been trying to celebrate how far i’ve come but the high has worn off. i was proud of myself for a while but i kept gaining and now i wish i could go back. i’ve been dealing with what feels like unrelenting hunger and i feel a lot of my binge eating tendencies coming back. i don’t want to flip from one side of the spectrum to the other then back again. the worst part is i miss it. so. badly. i keep reminding myself how miserable i felt overall, how much danger i was in but i can’t help but miss it regardless. what do i do? i don’t want to jeopardize my future. if not for my health, then i want to stay in recovery for the sake of my partner and any further children. i’m trying to remind myself of that goal but the urge is still so strong."
Recovery perk: getting stronger!,"I took a break from working out, but now I’m back in the gym and finally managing to do more reps on my PR at hip thrusts where I stagnated on forever while anorexic!! I

 know working out often is linked to ED behaviours but for me, seeing progress (in execution not how the body looks) is one of the things that motivates me to keep going even though recovery is so hard and I still cry daily"
Weight gain,Why does it seem like you gain weight so fast once you begin recovery?
How do I help someone else recover?,"My girlfriend has anorexia 

How do I incourage recovery without hurting her or making her feel more guilty about eating? She’s trying to improve and I hope I’m helping her but if someone could tell me the right way or how they would like to be or have been supported by their partner."
3 months purge free!!!,"A few months ago I was addicted to purging and thought I would be for the rest of my life. I wanted to stop so bad but I couldn’t. I was so scared for my health and every time I did it I would get panic attacks because I thought I was going to die. 


In January, purging sent me to the ER. I couldn’t see how bad it had gotten until then. The desire to lose weight had become more important than life. I was completely overridden by the ED. Looking around my room in the hospital I felt gut-wrenching, truly agonizing loneliness. I was miserable and felt pathetic. I realized I was in fact killing myself. And I decided I had to live.


And now here I am, three (!!!!!!) months without purging, which I NEVER thought would be possible. I can barely even believe it! I’m very proud of myself. Sometimes I look back and I hurt for this old version of me. But I can now say with certainty and confidence that I don’t want to be her ever again. I want to live."
My father commented that the goal weight the doctor set is too high,"During my appointment with the family therapist to start fbt, the therapist revealed the goal weight the doctor set for me. During lunch, my father said that the weight was too high, that xxkg was too much. I feel absolutely destroyed, the weight was my original weight before I got ill too. All I can hear is that my weight was too high and that all I’m doing is getting fat again. He also reacted to my weight being “so high” even when it was on the relatively lower end of a healthy bmi. It’s so hard to recover when the person that’s suppose to help me gain weight thinks the weight gain will be too much. Thankfully my mother understands more and told me to not bother about him, but I can’t help but still feel like I’m gaining too much."
Burning sensation in stomach,Does anyone feel this burning sensation in stomach that will only go away if you eat. Like I am constantly starving on the clock. It’s so scary. It burns even a hour after a huge meal ……
Itchy,"Sounds weird but I have anorexia ( no surprise, I'm on this page) and for some reason I have this itchiness over my legs face chest and and like in  my eyes it comes and goes throughout the day but at night it's really bad and drives me insane. The sensation is weird because it's itchy, yet a sort of tingling but also crawling  feeling. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this and if they know what it is/how to stop it. My doctor is a bit unsure so wondering if you had any ideas I could propose to him"
overshooting,"I know i know, it’s normal, but is there any way to avoid it? like, if i just start eating _ a lot_ will my metabolism fasten quicker and kind of reduce the ”risk” of overshoot?"
I scheduled my consultation for ED therapy.,"I don't know why I'm posting, I guess I'm just relieved, proud, scared, exhausted...all of the above. I've been inpatient plenty, but not for the past 8 years. In that time I got sicker than I've ever been and somehow managed to recover and find my way to a pretty fantastic life all on my own. But I recently suffered some accidental weight loss that triggered a wholeass relapse. 

The idea of fighting my way back to health, again, on my own is just...too much. But I'm not in need of the same critical intervention I was back when I was in and out of the hospital. Despite my hesitations and bad experiences, I'm trying to give specialized ED care another try. I want to recover to a place where I'm not so precariously close to relapse all the time. I want to get to an *actually* healthy weight. I want to eat proper meals, not just graze and binge on snacks. I don't want to forever be uneasy about restaurant meals and lazy days. I've tried it on my own for too long, and by most measures I've done great, but now I want more than I'm able to give myself."
Why can’t it just be easy?,"Right now I eat enough to keep my weight steady and every few weeks or so I gain about half a kilo. I can’t do more. I am at my limit. Physically and mentally. I get symptoms of extreme stress and even burnout and I just overall feel constantly down, anxious and stressed. I barely make any progress and it’s making me so angry. I hate it."
This is what life is about,"Life is about being able to shadow on a new job, knowing you could be there for anywhere from 2 to 4 hours. Going out to lunch at a new restaurant with your grandpa afterwards, and then spontaneously spending the night at your grandparents house. Getting ice cream at 10 PM when they suggest it, not because you are particularly hungry, but just because it sounds good and you are tired of saying no to life. It’s about getting up the next morning having no clue what you’re going to have for breakfast, and just figuring it out. 

Don’t get me wrong, my head is so loud, but the louder louder it is, the more rewarding is to take back."
will my boobs grow back?,"i never had big boobs but they were always like.. perky (this is awkward) 
but since i lost weight they got saggier and even some partners have noticed. now im insecure about them being saggy, im recovering now!! but I need to know if im forever stuck with saggy boobs or if they will come back when i gain weight. 

also side note: im actually kinda excited to gain weight?? weird honestly"
Hearing weight for first time,"I went to the doctor for the first time in actual recovery. Meaning, I had to step on the scale. Being previously addicted to weighing myself, my mom took it away from me because I would let the number on the scale control whether I “got to” eat or not. It has been much easier to get myself to eat after losing access to the scale. But after hearing my weight today, and having gained weight, it is triggering and kind of making me want to start restricting again:/"
Do you gain weight with hyper metabolism,Nothing fills me up. Literally nothing. I can eat three sandwiches and my stomach still is growling for food. I heard that during hyper metabolism you don’t actually gain weight. Is this true?
"Extreme guilt and compulsive thoughts about eating, scared of relapse","I can easily manage to eat my recommended calorie intake and I even try to challenge some fear foods every day but especially at night my compulsive thoughts kick in and I just want to go back to my old habits because I feel so guilty about eating. I feel like I'm gaining weight too fast (not really true) and I need to either work out after work (although I'm on my feet for a minimum of 6 hours, which is already a challenge physically) or purge my dinner or night snack. I try hard not to act on any of these thoughts but seeing how my body changes and feeling full but never satisfied makes me think if it's all really worth it. Deep inside I know that I need to keep going and that I need to gain some more weight to heal but I can't help but panic about my food intake. Has anyone else had this experience? Will the compulsive thoughts eventually just go away if I just keep gaining weight? I really don't want to trigger a relapse"
why am i still weak even after weight restoring?,"i expected my body to get more strong, and it did, but i can still barley do a proper pushup and much weaker than other people my age. i exercise somewhat regularly and am still weaker than my sister who is 2 years older than me and never exercises or does any sports. is it normal to still be kind of weak after a few months of weight restoration? is muscle something that grows naturally the longer i stay weight restored and recovered? or do i have start doing some muscle strengthening exercises and go out of my way to build it? ive been in recovery for about 7 months and weight restored for about 2-3 months."
i want to attempt recovery but i feel guilty,"i recently hit my gw, im 15, and i really don’t want to screw my life up even more than i already have. all these posts about dying from heart problems due to anorexia has really scared me and i want to attempt recovery. i hate myself for getting in this mess. where do i start? eating isn’t pleasant for me and calorie counting is a bad habit for me and it’s hard to quit it"
Need reassurance,"In beginning of recovering on my own at home, eating 2-3 meals a day, some smaller & some bigger depending, and a couple of snacks. I'm probably about a month in now. I was restricting for a year and a half before I decided I didn't want to anymore. So far, I AM starting to feel occasional hunger cues, but if I wait too long to eat it turns to nausea (or maybe that's just in my head). I'm not getting extremely lightheaded when I stand up anymore, as of a little over a week ago, which is a giant win for me. However, I'm EXTREMELY tired. I was tired before I started eating more, and probably about the same level of tiredness now. I have no energy and light exercise sucks the life out of me (ie walking). Even just household chores. I'm tired all day every day and it's scaring me. Is this normal? Will it go away? How can I make it go away faster if that's a thing? I'm terrified that there's something irreparably wrong in my body and I'm dying. But I assume it's still just malnutrition, I don't know. When will the exhaustion go away/lessen ?!?!!! All replies welcome and appreciated. Thank you"
What is your favorite foods to make ?,"Hello !

So I’ve become more open to the idea of cooking as I was able to get groceries with some help. I’ve never really been one to cook so I’m looking for some peoples favorite recipes or foods that I can maybe try to make. I personally am more pescatarian because of allergies so yea if anyone would like to share please feel free ! I’m honestly looking for a place about this because it’s been a very long time since I’ve been excited to cook and I’d like to keep that motivation hopefully and continue going forward !

So what are your favorite recipes or foods ?"
"Recovering, gaining one pound a day!","My question is can gaining weight back cause pelvic pain? I get sharp pains in my lower pelvic area especially when I binge eat.

Developing Diabetes in Recovery?,"I know this is probably irrational, since my A1C levels have always been in a healthy range, and if anything I dealt with \*low\* blood sugar while at an undernourished state, but: my bouts of extreme hunger/intense consumption of sweets during weight restoration/recovery has me worried that I'm going to develop diabetes, or do damage to my A1C levels..should I be worried? I've heard folks say these episodes/cravings will ""level out"" once I reach a ""healthy BMI""/am weight restored, but I still have doubts about that/am worried about what damage might be done in the process...."
Nausea in early ana recovery,
Maintaining UW,Ik this is disordered but for harm red I have upped my calories to 2.5 and am feeling so good cuz I can eat anything.harm reduction but I’m still UW and I do not exercise. Somehow I want to just be like this forever bc I’m able to eat snacks and meals and I love eating. Is there by any chance anyone that still stayed UW and eat at 2.5 with no exercise? I’m 5’4 btw and female.
difference in attitude/treatment as you get older,"idk if anyone else has experienced this but it’s really been bugging me lately. i’m under camhs right now, i first went and saw them when i’d jsut turned 13 for anorexia. back then the approach taken with me was ‘it’s a disease’ ‘not her choice she’s acting like that’ ‘we’re gonna help and support you so much to fight through this.’ it’s been over 3 years and i’m nearly 17 and i’m being treated now like my illness is a choice, i’m choosing this misery and nobody’s giving me any help anymore, they just say i have to do it on my own, at this point they can’t do anything etc etc and the only time they intervene is if i become too medically unstable and they send me to the hospital. 

basically- when i’m 13 it’s a disease when i’m 16 it’s a choice"

Nausea,"Hey everyone ! So, I've been anorexic for 6 years, and I got out a few months ago (I've gained 13kg !) . But since I gained that weight I've got sudden episodes of involuntary vomiting, out of the blue, I just get really nauseous, and throw up. Sometimes it's while doing groceries, sometimes it's just while reading at home. It happens approximately once a week.

So I wanted to ask if anybody's had anything similar happen, I wonder if it's anorexia recovery side effects (I eat well even if I have to put effort into remembering to eat when I'm alone, but don't throw up after meals and stuff so I'm not sure why or how it happens).

Thank you in advance ! I hope you all manage to recover !"
Should I start watching my diet?,"I am 15 years old and I have been in anorexia recovery for a year. In the year I have gained 5 kilos to weight restore to a healthy weight however I’ve still not gained my period back. Even though I gained weight I was still very mentally ill -so for a full month I tried going all in. I’ve been participating in all the meals and snacks my friends have when we go out , I eat loads at parties and try eat whatever food I want. In the month I have gained another 5 kilos. I’m obviously in a very high surplus and as I’m an athlete I’m scared that my weight will just keep going up. Should I start trying to have a healthier diet with more balance instead of trying to let myself eat everything I want?"
did the weight gain redistribute?,"hey. i struggled with anorexia during my high school years and now i’m on a couple medications; one of them mirtazapine, which severely increases my appetite. i’ve gained a bit of weight, but i swear it’s all staying around my middle and my face. 

i’ve heard that when someone who has been extremely malnourished for a long time starts gaining back weight, the body stores it around internal organs before redistributing it some time later. 

has anyone had experience with this happening? i don’t know. some reassurance would be nice."
Can I recover while still exercising,"I have gained some weight all ready, but even before my anorexia I was already a cyclist who trained for enjoyment. I'm still training at the moment, can my body still heal while exercising?"
Autism-friendly weight gain foods?,"I’m trying to gain back weight but am having difficulty finding foods I can eat that will help. I’m lactose intolerant and because of autism I have bad sensory issues with nuts/nut butters, seeds, and chocolate, so a lot of the usual high-cal options are a no-go. Does anyone have advice/suggestions for other foods that could help, or alternatively any ways to change/hide the taste and texture of the aforementioned foods?"
Why does plain water suddenly make me gag?,"This started happening during my ed(so that's why I'm asking here..) and is still going on, I can chug down a 750ml flavored water or a glass of soda with no problem, but I started gagging after half a 250ml glass of water, had to spit half of it out in the end.
The only way i can stay somewhat hydrated is soda, flavored water, energy drinks and etc and buying one of those every day quickly adds up and isn't very cheap 😬.
Anyone else going/went through this?"
How do you deal with the “loss of your identity” in recovery,"This is prob the thing I’ve struggled with most in recovery. I was very thin when anorexic and I’ve been in recovery for two years now and have put on a lot of weight. I don’t really mind the weight gain as I do think it makes me look healthier. However, a large part of my identity was tied to being very skinny and small and now I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. It sounds ridiculous even as I’m typing this out but I keep coming back to this thought. Has anyone dealt with this?"
Seeing treatment friends struggle is making me want to relapse,"Making this post partly to vent but also to look back onto when I need it

I know it’s bad but seeing friends relapse makes me competitive and it makes me feel like recovery is the wrong choice. 


To help with that here’s what I’ve been telling myself:


- They must be miserable. I know the life they’re living all too well and there’s no pleasure in it. I don’t want to go back to it.


- Yes, they’re losing weight, but there would be no real benefit if I did too. The cons would outweigh the pros by a whole lot.


- I have a whole life to lose weight if I decide to. I can go back to the ED whenever if recovery doesn’t feel worth it. But if I don’t at least give it a shot I will never know.


- I’m still young. Most of the friends I met in treatment are in their late 20s to 40s. I don’t want to live that long being controlled by anorexia.


- I have goals that I want to achieve. I have a whole life to build for myself and to pursue. But choosing the ED will 100% keep me from doing so. I cannot live a full life on an empty stomach.


The thing is these statements are hard to actually fully believe. But I can say after writing this that I already feel a little better. It’s really difficult nonetheless. I’m still all ears if you have tips. Love you all 🧡

anyone else developed an ED CAUSED by chronic pain and pain meds?¿,"(also posted this in the chronicpain sub but didn't get any responses, so I'm hoping to get some engagement here)

I've been on many different kind of painmeds since I was 12 (I'm 19 now). ofc these meds come with side effects and one of them is influencing your weight/appetite, some increasing it some decreasing it. 

These side effects regarding weight/appetite have eventually led me to develop an eating disorder along with the chronic pain. Eating disorders are ofc often rooted in wanting to have a sense of control and since I couldn't get my pain under control I started controlling my weight.

There are a few other things I think that led me to developing an ED but I'm just curious to hear other people's experiences with these kinds of issues. Doc said that she treated a chronic pain patient who also had an ED in the past but idk the ins and outs of that case of course, I just know that it exists as an comorbidity appearantly.

btw I have my first intake appointment at the ed clinic today, wish me luck :)

ETA: idk if it is of any importance but I suspect it to be AN-bp subtype

ETA2:  It should be 'facilitated by chronic pain and meds' instead of 'caused'. I've worded it wrong"
Eating felt okay,"And it’ll make you feel good as well :)

Eat your full meal plan, have that extra snack, feel great with me 

PS: It doesn’t matter if you sat around all day or were active 
EAT"
Clothes shopping help,"I’m currently shopping for new clothing and I don’t know if I should buy the the size I am now or slightly larger, just enough to have a bit of room.

I’m recently weight restored, but just barely so  I know that weight gain is likely to still happen… and I’m trying to be ok with that.

Tight clothing is also somewhat triggering, so I don’t want that be be a problem and I don’t want to have to go shopping again soon because of money. 

My mom and sister think it makes no sense to get clothing that isn’t perfectly my size right now, I just don’t know."
I messed everything up again,"I’m going back IP this week almost a year to the day I went IP last year to the same facility. It’s embarrassing because I feel like I haven’t made progress in one year. I have to give up my summer job which I love as well. Also, (and the hardest part) I am not nearly as sick as I was last year. My bmi is about >!15.2!< and last year when I went IP it was >!12.9!< . I am almost >!20!< lbs heavier now then last year so I don’t feel like I deserve it or I need to get sicker so I’m not the biggest one there. I also plan to leave early for uni in sept so I am really treating this like a jolt to my system."
Went from hiding food because I didn't want to eat to hiding chocolate wrappers because I'm too ashamed to admit how much I actually ate 🥲,Does the cycle ever end 😭
Recovering before my appointment,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with AN(B/P) about 2 weeks ago, but my treatment only officially starts in a few days after I see the family therapist. In this past 2 weeks I’ve been trying to recover on my own, but overeating by A LOT(extreme hunger and what not). I’ve gained significant weight since then and I feel like such a fraud. I’m so afraid the family therapist won’t take me seriously and even more I’m scared my parents won’t take me seriously. What are your experiences with self recovery before treatment?"
How to feel less sick after overeating?,"So basically I was making some chocolate muffins today and had some melted chocolate and bananas left over(which I of course ate since I have the self control of a toddler) and then accidentally burned my first batch(6 muffins) which I didn't want to give to my family so I ate them, this was after a full day of eating(3 meals+ 2 snacks this was supposed to be my 3rd snack and I was planning on eating one or two but kinda lost control) and now I feel incredibly sick, and I'm still at a slightly underweight weight do my stomach hurts from bloating and it feels like it's about to rip my skin from stretching.

Anyone got tips that would help me 🥲, I've tried drinking water but i think it just made it worse"
No more complements,"Maybe it's just my family but I stopped getting complements from them when I started putting on weight whike recovering. It made me realize that a lot of complements were either directly or indirectly about my body and how skinny I was. I'm still underweight according to bmi but maybe because I'm pear shaped (which I only discovered after recovery weight gain) that I'm no longer seen as skinny. It just sucks. It's affecting my recovery but it's not their fault, they didn't even know I had ana."
RANT: Feeling Like A Faliure,"The title pretty much sums it up. I have been slipping backwards in my recovery and I hate myself for it. I don’t even really know why I’m doing it or what even started it. I can venture some guesses but I’m not positive. I hate that this illness has been overtaking my brain recently and feels like all I can think about. I feel terrible that my partner is worried for my safety. We practically live together and therefore have meals (or for my part lack thereof) together. I don’t want to be sick. I don’t want to have this issues. But I feel like I just can’t stop. I want to eat, but I can’t bring myself to do it. In my brain, no food is “safe” so I just don’t eat anything. For days at a time. I can’t stand myself for that. Just fucking eat something. It’s not that hard. But it is. The idea of putting food into my body terrifies me. I thought I was fine. I thought I was past all this ED thinking. But I guess not? Like part of it will always live in my brain. Why can’t I just be okay again? Why can’t I do this basic live sustaining task? I don’t want to starve myself to death. I have life plans I want to see out and at the rate I’m going I’m never going to. And I hate that I’m coherent enough to recognize that but not enough to stop what I’m doing. I just want to be okay again. I want to be able to eat without fear again. 

I feel so guilty about what I’m doing to myself and what I’m putting my partner through as they watch me do this to myself. They don’t deserve that. I hate that someone else is seeing me so sick. I’d hide it from them better but I think a part of me doesn’t want to? Like I need someone to see how not okay I am. But I fucking hate myself for that. I don’t know. I don’t know where I go from here. I don’t just want to get better but I need to. Failure isn’t an option here. I am going to get better again. Relapse is a part of recovery. A shitty part. But it’s a part of it. I need to keep going. I’ve got too many good things going for me to just give up on myself."
Men getting upset over the amount you eat?,"Why are men bothered by the amount you eat? 

I am now a recovered anorexic, but my whole life I have always felt awkward eating a lot in front of others/cannot eat a lot in one sitting. 

I never really thought this was a big deal, but I noticed that whenever I eat with men this seems to really bother them a lot. And not in a “concerned about you” way, in like a “off putting” and “you did something wrong/abnormal” way. I am a very short girl, and have a small mouth, so it’s not that I’m not eating, but it’s hard for me to eat fast/finish the full dish without getting really full. I don’t really see how this is a bother at all to anyone else, especially dudes who typically aren’t as food focused, but I keep getting comments like “you barely even ate anything...” “aren’t you going to eat more” “is that all you’re going to eat” with a bothered or critical tone. It feels very impolite to me because it will be food that I payed for, ate a regular amount (I’m not out here eating like 3 fries), and bring back in a doggy bag to not waste it. 

What’s funny is that then the next time I’ll eat more and they’ll be like “you ate a lot” and then ask for the rest of my food while I’m still eating LOL. Like why are you watching how much I eat and why are you offended by it? But also don’t care? Does anybody else have similar experiences/any two cents on this???"
Recovery,"Is over feeding other people an effect of anorexia? I enjoy watching other people eat and tend to over feed my husband, kids and nanny"
lost months of progress to a stomach bug,"it's so demotivating, i had gained a pretty significant amount since my worst in 2021, slow progress but better than dying, obviously. i just lost 1/4th of my progress to a stomach bug that made it impossible to keep anything down for a week, and now my BMI is back down to unhealthy levels. even worse, me and my girlfriend got in a fight and haven't talked for 9 days, and i got the bug 7 days ago so when she comes back and notices i'm significantly thinner she'll think it's her fault and might not believe my explanation"
Triggering comment made by dad,"Yesterday I went to my father’s house to have dinner with him. 

For context, he is very heavily into fitness and diet culture. He might very well have an ED too. He has always been extreme in his points of views. And he doesn’t know I’ve been sick. One time my mother talked with him about my eating and he got worried but he forgot about it the next week. I don’t want him to know either because he wouldn’t think it’s serious and he would want us to share tips and tricks or whatever. 

Everytime I go and visit him he tells me about his diet and exercise. I never engage in the conversation, I don’t answer or react to anything he says. Yet he still goes on to tell me about it. It truly angers me that he is so tone deaf.

Anyways, yesterday, he told me all the details about his diet: what he eats, when, how much he exercises, blah blah blah. I told myself to ignore it, not let it get to me etc. But then, he told me his weight and said the most triggering shit! He said “I probably weigh less than you do, my weight is sickly”. That instantly made me switch to competition mode. 

I truly was trying to give recovery my all until then, and it hasn’t been easy. But that comment made me want to relapse so bad. I try to tell myself that I know the lifestyle he’s living and it’s miserable. But it’s so hard to actually not crave it. Knowing my own father analyses my body makes me even more  afraid of gaining weight. What will he think of me when I weight restore?? Even worse, what will others think of even my dad finds me fat? I just want to forget what he said but I can’t."
"Smol rant, can ignore","Fully recovered for, around a year now?? And trust me when I said I fully recovered, as I'm living a happy life recovering from all my mental illness and I eat normal portions happily nowadays.. But being okay and energised made me want to live healthier, which makes restricting myself to eat before bed although it's been 6 hours since my dinner. Dumb me went through mental gymnastics about should I eat or not, ended up binging. Now I feel like I've relapsed a little bit. Though I know tmr ill be good as new again. I just feel so dumb lol"
Recovery feels impossible,"Hi everyone, I’m feeling very sad and have a bleak outlook to my future. I attempted recovery by slowly increasing my cals weekly from the end of June. Then on Saturday extreme hunger kicked in, again on Tuesday. I honoured it both days but freaked out and went the other way. I have sadly relapsed and am now actually worse than I was a month ago. I just feel like there’s no way out! I have had my initial ED clinic assessment where I was formally diagnosed with anorexia, have my first dietician appointment next week and a follow up appointment in a couple of weeks. I have blood tests and ECGs booked in and i’m on the waitlist for the outpatient day unit. So the professionals are doing a lot for me! I have private therapy weekly. My family and friends have also been great. I got broken up with a couple of weeks into starting recovery which knocked me massively, I have severe anxiety and depression. Can’t work and can barely function currently. I have no joy in anything and no motivation driving me forward. The gastro symptoms have been really stressing me out, especially the bloating. I just don’t know how I’m possibly able to get better and eat normally without either fear of putting weight on or being unable to restrain myself and turning into bingeing. I want to get better but see no reason to currently so I’m not trying. Please tell me it’s possible to get past this? I’m so miserable and life feels like it’s not worth living. I hate this illness SO MUCH."
"Burning sensation in stomach, started all in recovery a week and a half ago","It has all been going well until a day ago, i am not sure if it is getting my physical hungers cues back or if it is a stomach problem, but my stomach has been having a searing/burning pain in it and my whole body has been achey. Did this happen to anyone else in recovery? Is it actual hunger cues, so far i have just been responding to mental hunger cues."
Resources for explaining (adult) recovery to family?,"Hi!! I'm an adult and don't live with my parents, but since I told them about my diagnosis, they've expressed that they want to do what they can to support me.
I do occasionally visit for weekends and whatnot every few months, but apart from that, it's mostly long distance. I'm very grateful for the support and I find it really valuable, especially when I'm struggling emotionally, but we've encountered some difficulties where they just don't understand the disorder or the recovery process enough to help, or accidentally say something unhelpful (ie. my mum telling me to eat ""healthy foods"" when I was debating on whether or not to let myself eat chocolate).
However, all the resources I can find aimed at explaining things to parents are aimed at parents of teenagers who still rely on them for meals, and most family-focused ones expect a degree of contact that isn't really relevant when mine are... about 400 miles away. Everything I can find explaining things like extreme hunger and how/why meal plans work is aimed at the person with the disorder, so they rely on a kind of understanding of context that my (thankfully non-disordered) parents don't really have.
I've been trying to explain things to them myself, but I'm not the best at communicating and their misunderstandings can be genuinely upsetting, so it'd be really useful to be able to just send them a document or two to read through and ask questions on, rather than having to try to address everything from scratch off the top of my head.
TLDR: does anyone know of any good resources to explain the recovery process to long-distance parents who want to understand how they can support you?"
Just a quick reminder that it's okay to,"Eat more than people around you
Have dessert even after a full day of eating
Have a snack if you're hungry even if you ate recently
Choose the ""unhealthy"" option
Seek help even if you think you're not sick enough
Eat even if you were sitting or laying down for most of the day"
Struggling - advice for being OK with not losing weight,"I  had severe anorexia from september 2021-may 2022, but when I recovered I did not recover right. I started reactive eating and in may I was sick of being sick and this horrible cycle of trying to eat so little and feeling awful so I tried to recover.

Although I gained weight, gained a healthier mindset, and have improved my mental health by alot which in turn decreased my obsession with relapse

but I still struggle, since I started ""recovering"" I have been in a cycle of trying to lose weight, binge eating, rinse and repeat. I still count what I eat and have a bit of an exercise obsession

I cant get the desire to lose weight out of my mind, even losing weight in  healthy way s constantly on my mind and I just want to lose weight so I restrict then overeat

It is hard to eat maintainace, I feel like I need to always be in a deficit

What do I do?"

Struggling,"Not sure where to really start this...

i've been discharged and techincally ""recovered"" for 11 years this year.

Its been a massive 18 months of some crazy changes in my life which i've managed to deal with having a lack of control over etc.

Just yestrday signed over contracts for a new home, and everything has happened insanely quick.

and since last night invasive thoughts over my eating have become so so loud.

too the point i've only managed to eat a small amount in this time.  the sickness that comes with it all is so overwhelming and even after all these years im really strugging to move past it all even with safety foods.

I know some people say its only been like 48 hours but in the last 11 years i've not felt this bad, its like an itch i cant control or sooth like all the last 11 years of having control have gone out the window and every bad thought i've had to do with my body, my image, my eating, my weight etc has flooded in.

How do i ask for help at a higher weight?,"Hi!!

TW: i talk about my ED mindset in this post.

I’m 1 month in recovery from AN. I’ve gained weight. However i don’t have a diagnosis. I have an unofficial ED recognition from my therapist who does not specialize in EDs.

This is mainly because I’ve been able to go without recognition because i have many health issues that i blame a lot of my symptoms on. Like i have POTS to blame for low blood pressure and Gastroparesis for everything else.

I’m terrified of seeking help without having a diagnosis. I’m scared i’m going to be told i no longer count as being anorexic just because i’ve gained a bit. That would make me relapse in a heartbeat. Even just when my therapist said i’m “not severely underweight or at risk of death” triggered me for weeks. Maybe i need to see an ED therapist? Nobody’s ever told me i’m gonna die from my ED so i don’t feel like i’m gonna last in recovery. Is it wrong to need that validation to fully recover? 

Also, i’ve attempted recovery in the past without help and in that time i told my doctor i wanted to gain weight but didnt explain why, so i’m scared that having wanted to gain in the past will make me seem like i’m lying.

     I am choosing not to go to my closest ED clinic for a few reasons. The main one is that it is strictly family-based and would require me to do family therapy. 
    However my therapist (and past ones i’ve had) and i have agreed that i should not attempt family therapy again because they lie during it and if the therapist does not agree with them and hail them as perfect, they stop going. I don’t live with my family anymore and it’s been a huge benefit for my mental health and recovery. The way they comment on my food and weight has not changed despite me begging them to be supportive. It would just give them another way to control me. 
     Another reason is simply that the clinic has terrible reviews.

So basically if i’m not in a clinic i don’t know what my options are. I’m scared to tell my doctor. I don’t know if i can recover with my current supports because i’m not held accountable. 

Honestly all i want is an official diagnosis so i can feel valid. I used to want to be hospitalized so bad but that would take away so much of my freedom i’ve fought for.

It would help to hear if anybody else has an experience of asking for help after having recovered a bit and what challenges come with it."
Mental hunger but no specific cravings?,"In the past when I would get mental hunger I would always have specific cravings related to it. This time around, I keep having thoughts about eating but I can’t figure out what I want. Also, thinking about specific foods kind of disgusts me. Has anybody experienced this and if so, how did you tackle it?"
Managed to challenge all of my fear foods today!,"Soft serve ice cream- obvious why it was ff
Cappuchino and slushie- liquid calories
Burger that actually has sauce and isn't dry- fast food + sauces
4 donuts and a croissant- pastry 
Half a pack of jaffa cakes- sweets

I already managed to challenge pastry, sweets and fast food prior to this but i would usually restrict just so I could have one of those, and I did all of this without feeling the  need to restrict?!?!
And I managed to fit all of this in without binging??!?!?! I think the fact that i ate whatever I craved when eh hit really helped w that"
fear of not being hungry enough for next meal,"DAE struggle with feeling afraid to eat to their true hunger because they fear they won’t be hungry enough to enjoy their next meal? i’m a teenager so i still live at home and therefore don’t have full control over when mealtimes are, what the portions are, what the meals themselves will be - so sometimes i worry that for example if i ate until full satisfaction at breakfast and felt quite physically full, nd lunch was only a couple hours later, i wouldn’t feel hungry enough for lunch but there would be nothing i could do about that because it’s “lunchtime”. this leads to me feeling like i have done something wrong or overeaten, and so the next day i restrict at breakfast or snack just so that i can leave myself enough hunger to justify my next meal. eating when i’m not hungry just feels so wrong, but then it’s also exhausting restricting beforehand just to experience that hunger. i just wish that my mealtimes and snacktimes were fully in my control rather than half in half out because it means that if i get hungry, i don’t know whether to have a substantial snack or not, even if i’m hungry for it, because i don’t know when my family will say it’s dinner time. idk, i know this may be coming from an unhealthy mindset of meals having to be “perfectly enjoyed” and putting food on a pedestal, but it genuinely makes me so anxious when i’ve pushed myself to eat to my full hunger at breakfast or snack and tried to remind myself that i’m listening to my body’s signals, but then not long afterwards i’m made to eat and then it’s like well what’s the point in listening to my hunger - it has to go both ways. any advice on how to deal with this would be welcome  - sorry for such a disjointed post, i hope what i’m saying makes sense!"

Thinking of what I put myself through hurts so much,"I lost years of my life chasing sick enough. I gave everything I had to this disorder and it took so much more. It’s left me lonely, sad, with no occupation or goals. I feel pathetic. None of this was worth it, truly. Now it’s like I woke up from a coma and I have to face the emptiness that is left. This hurts so much, far more than being sick. There’s nothing I wish more than to go back in time. I wish none of this had ever happened."
its hard to be ok with not being underweight,"I have been trying to eat at maintainance at I ate fear food today but its really hard

Seeing a triggering person,"Circumstances have arisen for a trip to the state most of my family lives in. The last time I was up there, there was a big family event in which most of them saw me pre-recovery. 

There is one person (though she didn’t see me last time) who may have an eating disordered past. There’s additional details but I’m not trying to trigger anyone else nor over share. 

Part of me is nervous to see a number of people for the first time since gaining weight. They don’t know I’m in active recovery for an ED. 

But then I think of when I was in a dated ER, with my heart rate really low and my daughter crying at the side of the bed. I cannot willingly go back to that. It’s bad enough I’ve already put us through this.

I choose to live."
Extreme hunger/short term restriction??,"Hi, I have recently been diagnosed with anorexia. I’m luckily only just in the underweight category and probably only need to put on a few pounds. I restricted from end of March until July so only 3.5/4 months tops. With this in mind, how long will my extreme hunger last?? I’m finding it extremely overwhelming and upsetting. I have honoured it today but the uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and the GUILT is driving me crazy! It’s just bowl after bowl of muesli or granola with chocolate soya milk - for some reason this is my only craving! With the occasional protein bar. Other than that I have no cravings. If I ride this out and completely give in, will it be over fairly soon? Because I truly can’t do this long term. My body already looks different and I’m struggling! I have been trying to reverse diet since the end of June, adding 100 cals a week and am almost at my “maintenance” amount, it was going well until Saturday when extreme hunger kicked in which I honoured on Saturday and today. Also the gastro symptoms of bloating/water retention/gas are driving me mad. Please tell me these pass quickly!! Thanks"
Found a way to stop myself from binging!,"Im not sure if this will help anyone else but desserts after every meal.
Dont eat less than you would during the actual meal to ""save"" for the dessert, i usually try to see it as a part of the meal so i dont do that.

Fruit salad with some sort of spread on the side, so far i only did nutella but i think peanut butter, greek yogurt or like fruit yogurt (maybe even pudding or ice cream, you can go crazy with the sides!)could work with some fruit.

Keeps me full for way longer than just a meal would plus its delicious!
I use about one spoon(the childrens ikea spoons which are somewhere between a tablespoon and a teaspoon when it comes to size)
Also way less guilt and no nausea"

Need to vent - slight tw,"I was bloated for some time since starting recovery, then had troubles eating due to teeth problems. Since then some time has passed and I've been able to eat more again.
I now take care about what I eat due to the teeth problems before. This however doesn't mean I eat less, but way more.

I get hunger pangs and feel weak if I don't eat a lot. My body re-nurishes itself, which is great.

My problem now is; Even with eating about 2x to 3x even 4x more calories compared to back then (when anorexia slowly didn't have much control over me anymore) I've lost weight. 

It's still at a healthy range but it's kind of scary to know. The same occurred two years ago. I've lost more the more I ate.

I'm at my wits end because I can't eat more than I am now. I'm so full at the end of the day I have trouble sleeping sometimes.

I  eat more than most people I know and am not active much, except for sometimes weightlifting and yoga or taking a walk. 

It's frustrating because ana's still there in the back of my mind, waiting. 
It's also frustrating because I'm trying to gain weight and getting muscular."
AMA recovered for 10 years!,"I did this a few months ago and got a lot of engagement, I thought it would be time to do it again.

Judgemental of other peoples’ recovered bodies,"I feel like it’s always assumed that just because I have an eating disorder, I have body dysmorphia, but that’s just never resonated for me. I’m quite certain I have an accurate perception of myself. It’s not just my own body that I think looks better at a very low bmi, I’m equally as judgemental of other peoples’ bodies. I just think underweight looks better - every time I was in treatment, I felt like people looked better when they came in than when they left. It seems like no one ever really talks about this. I only hear other people talking about how xx healthy weight is okay for other people, just not themselves. But what about when you just think underweight looks better? Am I some weird anomaly? Does anyone else feel this way? It makes me really unenthusiastic about gaining weight when I just fundamentally think underweight looks more aesthetically appealing. I know aesthetics can change, but how do I go about convincing myself to think that normal looks okay?"
I hate my “recovered” body so much I cry when I look in the mirror,"This year I developed anorexia, I have restored my weight for 2 months now (yes I know, only had it for 6 months but enough for me to lose my period from Jan to June this year). I used to go to the gym not because I wanted to burn calories. I didn’t love my body but I accepted it. I was considered slim and fit. After recovery I have lots of cellulite, I can’t stand looking at myself in the mirror. It makes me want to relapse, recovery feels much harder than the negative side effects when I was underweight…"
Extreme Hunger issues,Any tips to manage the extreme hunger because Im still scared of gaining and i just want to eat to a maintenance level but oh my god once i grab one bite no one can stop me from putting the fork down .. im already up to 3kgs in 5 days (half of it it’s just tons of watermelon) .. idk if it’s just food weight / water weight or real weight but it’s so scary i really need some reassurance please .
I'm Scared,"It's been months since I've been recovering. Technically 2 years? I was hospitalized in October 2021 and was forced into recovery for the remainder of the year. Then I relapsed really badly last summer but chose to finally recover for myself sometime in September.

Since then I've been doing really well, weight restored, got my period back, healthy hair, and all the benefits. But I also went through extreme hunger, and still am. The thing is, my extreme hunger isn't like most peoples,, I'm fine during the day, I eat normally, but then as soon as dinner is over I just need to keep eating. Once I'm done with one thing I'm immediately onto another and I only stop once I feel like I'm about to barf. I let it pass, then I just keep eating until I'm shaking in pain. It's not like an every-once-in-a-while type thing, it's every. damn. day. Every day since January. I genuinely feel as though I can't stop, and it scares me because that's how I used to behave when I was younger and suffered with binge problems. 

So I guess my main questions are:

\- Is this normal? 

\-Has anyone else had extreme hunger like this? 

\-Is this even extreme hunger?? (because it doesn't feel like it) 

And finally, does anyone have any tips on how to help this? Make it better? Maybe I'm somehow doing recovery wrong and need someone to point it out? 

Thank you xx"
Body checking and body dysmorphia,"I struggle with ever knowing I’m looking at myself as I am. 
Does that make sense?

Like, I don’t trust my eyes are telling me the truth. I body check so much and I know I need to stop but this post isn’t about that, it’s about whether some of us truly don’t see how we really look? 

For example
I always hate being in photos. Always feel that at the time I look HIDEOUS. Then a few years later I am like oh ok I look ok there. Or I might even *gasp* like the way I look. I usually will be like hold on I hated how I looked, I was way bigger/uglier/whatever, what’s going on!?!?

Just wanting to see if anyone else relates. 
Thanks for reading."

I’ve been committing to the whole 3 meals 3 snacks thing for 2-3 weeks and always go to bed stuffed… I truly ate good today, I had a lot of high energy foods and I’m sure it was more than enough. I don’t think I can eat more without the guilt feeling overbearing"
F*ck calories,"I decided what wanted to eat before getting to the restaurant and the menu had calories when I got there. I didn’t expext it and ended up seeing them.

I still have a long way to go but little wins are still wins!! 💜"
Anyone else use psychelics to treat their eating disorder?,"I just found this sub, and thought I’d share my experience briefly. When I was 19 I was at my absolute worst (28m, now). I fell in with a few hippie friends around that time who introduced me to LSD and the second time I took it, they told me to focus on one negative thing in my life. I used all my energy to battle anorexia that evening and quite literally; to this day, I’ve never restricted once. 

It was a night and day difference. I woke up the following morning and saw myself for what I was: *the scrawniest, sickest, tiniest* guy that desperately needed to gain weight to stay healthy, happy, and live a long life. I loved myself, *as foreign as it was*. Now, I still have days where I may feel as if I don’t look perfect, but who doesn’t? But when I look down and see 160 as oppose to 89, I don’t think twice. 

I don’t know. *If this isn’t approved, I apologize and please delete this*. I would keep an open mind in your journey towards recovery. This personally popped into my mind tonight as I’m about to head out to dinner with one of those friends and am so excited to chow down and catch up. I’m not controlled by my disease and haven’t been for almost a decade. 

My heart is with all of you."
Do you consider spotting for 2 days getting your period back?,I got some mild cramping and then realized I was spotting. Barely anything but still technically blood/period. Does this count as not having amenorrhea anymore?

Extreme hunger and focusing issues,"Did anyone, during their extreme hunger phase felt like they CANNOT FOCUS. all I can think about is food and I’m so dizzy everyday. It’s torture. Please let me know if anyone experienced this as well. My brain is just constantly foggy and all I can think about is food food food. It’s so tiring and so scary."
Can’t stop binge eating…,"-Potential trigger warning for anyone thinking about recovery because I know this is a big fear that puts a lot of people off-

Hii, not sure what I’m looking for here other than support but I started on my recovery journey back in January and I’m at the point now where I’m weight restored but gaining quickly and have become really reliant on comfort eating:(

For the first couple of months of my recovery I was still being really restrictive and considering eating over my daily recommended calorie intake as “losing control”. I went through a really difficult family situation though in around March and started slowly having more and more days where I would seek out all the foods I’d been craving for the last few years from my days binge eating before i went back into restrictive eating and developed anorexia. At first, I was still so scared to eat things I didn’t know the calorie count of, but I think I started telling myself it was just that extreme hunger and once I got all the cravings out my system and wasn’t starving anymore I wouldn’t feel the need to eat so excessively anymore. I never felt good after I did it and especially at the beginning, I would follow that up with restricting.

But it’s like I got to a certain point and thought fuck it, I’m going to gain this weight either way and just started eating everything I wanted, constantly. I didn’t want to restrict myself so the slightest craving for something would be enough to make me want to go out and get it and then think “oh, whilst I am it, I really fancy some x, y, z….”

The thing is, I thought this would’ve gone away by now but if anything, I need less and less to justify it and I’m eating more and more without feeling full, sometimes days over my recommended intake. I despise how my body looks and if I continue this way I will be overweight within a few weeks. I’m eating the equivalent of a pound’s worth of calories every day and the thought of binging feels like the only thing getting me through the day because I get excited to eat and feel free to eat what I want. A “balanced” diet still feels restrictive and I’ll still hate my body. So it feels like what’s the point? I may as well go back to full fledged restriction because the middle ground is still making me fucking miserable. When I speak to my therapist and we go through the things I can do to stop binging, I am motivated to do the things we work through together and that lasts for like, one day, and the next day I’m miserable again and it feels like I’m depriving myself of what I actually want for no reason except not to be “ill” anymore. But if I’m depressed and still feel trapped and still have all this self-hatred and STILL an anorexic mindset, what motivation is there NOT to just go back to restricting? 

It feels like I’m trapped between binge eating and overweight, miserable and “healthy” but still not having anything I want and hating my body, or restricting where I actually DON’T feel disgusted by my body and the only negative of consequence is that I feel like I’m letting people down and will be lying to my therapist.

I am so sick of having my life controlled by this and it feels like I am just programmed to either be overweight or anorexic forever. It’s all I’ve ever known and there no evidence to believe it could be any other way. From the moment I’ve had control over my own diet I’ve either been gradually gaining weight or losing it. I’m fed up."
Should I try to suppress extreme hunger or listen to it?,"From 7AM-10AM I had a mushroom pie for breakfast then a bit of currant and like 4 cubes of cantaloupe. Then I went out in town to get some stuff done and ended up eating 3 kinder joy eggs  two scoops of ice cream and some blackberries 😵‍💫 
I feel like I've had a bit too much, but I also have to ear two more full meals and I'm afraid of falling into the restriction loop again"
I’m too scared to continue,"I hate the way I look
I hate the way I feel 
I feel horrible about myself 
Everyone told me this was a better life for me, and I know I’m only fresh into recovery, (a month or so) but I hate everything about myself and I miss my old body. 

Idk what to do - I feel like I’m never going to be okay with ‘being better’"
How to get back menstrual cycle?,"I lost my period in order to get my period back
I have to gain weight since in this community doesn't allow numbers... 
I went dietitian and she recommended me a weight range l should be for my height.
If l become the weight she recommended will my period be back?
I searched that in order to have periods women needs at least %20 body fat.  
When l'm become the ideal weight the dietitian recommended me.. my body fat will %20-21
Will my period be back or l HAVE to gain more?

(ETA the two first phrases I forgot to add)"
Always hungry and it's been almost a year of recovery,"I've had extreme hunger throughout, but the last couple weeks have been something else. I feel so unhealthy and like I can't stop snacking. Nothing is making me full for longer than an hour. I'm going to try to replace the food in my house with healthy, more filling snacks because I think part of my distress is by how much junk food and sweets I can pack away and still be hungry. 

I feel like I have no control. I check the scale and the way my stomach and face look in the mirror multiple times a day. I just don't know how to snap out of this."
Low blood sugar and dizzy in recovery?,"Does anyone else get dizzy with low blood sugar if they go a few hours with out food in recovery? I've had bloods done and they look ok, I've been gaining weight at a steady pace for a few months as well? thank you"
A little challenge idea for recovery,"If you ever find yourself thinking whats the lowest calorie item on the menu or wherever you are, get exactly what your eating disorder doesent want you to get, which means whatever sounds like its high in calories but looks appealing to you.
I feel like this mainly applies to early recovery, taking control over your eating habits from your Ed is a very important part of recovery. 

Bonus challenge idea:
Have a day where you eat what your younger self would choose, I did a few where I would try to think what 7 year old me would like to eat for each meal and honestly even though it  brought a bit of guilt since it was early rec, it was a fairly enjoyable experience"
Anorexia body image suicidal thoughts,"


Hey anyone reading. I've been in recovery from anorexia on and off for about a year now . I do pretty well with food these days and have been at a healthy weight for quite a while now but have been struggling massively with body image.
I'm completely obsessed with my body shape and having a totally flat stomach. I try to tell myself there's more important things in life than how I look but I  just feel terrible about myself constantly.
I haven't had any suicidal thoughts for a long time but the last few days I'm finding it hard to cope with all the negative thoughts. Sometimes it feels it would easier if I wasn't here anymore so I wouldn't have to struggle everyday . I want to have a normal life again so bad but it's felt hopeless lately.
Anyone have any words of motivation or is anyone else having similar struggles 💙"

Pelvic floor distinction,Hi so I’ve been in recovery for a year now and I had anorexia for 4 years. For 8 months I’ve been experiencing fluid leakage out of my an** whenever I have to go poop but can’t yk like when there’s no toilet near me. as soon as I go to the toilet I have a wet patch in my underwear and I’ve been checked for haemorrhoids but don’t have them. I have IBS so idk if it’s from that. Does anybody else have this 😭 and it’s only ever when I have to poop but can’t go.
Heart rate/heart muscle,"Hey everyone, I am in recovery (3 weeks eating above maintenance) following a period of about 11 months restriction. Whilst I was restricting my heart rate would regularly drop pretty low >!(40s)!<, but since I've been eating more/regularly this has only happened once or twice. I have noticed though that when I go for too long without eating my heart rate starts to dip again. Does anyone know how to explain this? I guess I assumed that during restriction your body is kind of in starvation mode and shutting down as many functions as possible to preserve energy. But now I'm not restricting, and my body knows it will be getting enough food, why is my heart rate dropping still at times when I haven't eaten? Does anyone know the mechanism by which your heart muscle gets smaller/weaker during anorexia? And how this recovers or restores itself? Thank you in advance x"
OCD and anorexia?,I’ve started eating less again… at first I thought it was just depression but I’m not currently depressed. I’m just following a habit probably… I have OCD and I’ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety over some recent long term changes in my life. So maybe I’m trying to take control by limiting food intake? Idk I’ve gained weight this year and so far I had been really positive about it but I feel myself slipping… I’m not eating meals at all right now. Just little bits of food here and there. Any advice? Anyone else with OCD and AN comorbidity?
A tip for eating out,"I know I’m going out for food can be extremely scary, and often feels like a whole ordeal. To me, the idea that it could ever feel like “ any other normal meal” it’s still something I struggle with. Something that has really helped you with this, however, is getting an extra item (usually just a side dish or a roll) and taking it to go. Then the next day, I will use it in a regular meal as my my carb, protein, a swap, or whatever part of my meal plan it will fulfill. It’s still challenging, but it’s really good way to start seeing those items as regular things I can incorporate into the rest of my eating. 

You all are amazing and you’ve got this!!"
Why is it so difficult?,"... to recover... From the outside, to a lot of people it really seems as simple as 'just eat or you will die! what's not to understand? just freakin do it, huh!?'. It really does, and a lot of lack of sympathy for ED suffering people comes from it.

As a former substance addict, I know first hand how limited the outside look can be.

Still, I haven't experienced anorexia and as a soon-to-be psychologist I would like you to help me understand, describe the difficulty in some way. What does it feel like? What would you compare it to?"
Go to movie theater snacks,For some reason I have Ana aniexty (is that a thing) over what to get as a snack for when I go see Barbie later today. During my Ana I would just bring trail mix. Then when I was recovered I bought like a small bag of popcorn and even after I would share popcorn with my sister and get candy and call that my lunch and I didn’t care. I think I’m freaking out cause it’s summer I wanna look good and I’m going on a cruise next week and wanna save the treats until then so what’s your movie snack
Joint pain,"I started trying to recover from my ED at the beginning of the year but also started exercising, doing cardio workouts, walking etc all while not eating anywhere near enough. Around this time I started having joint pain, specifically in my hip & ankle. I stopped doing all that exercise a few months ago and am now eating a lot more, however I’m still having joint pain.
I tend to be quite anxious about my health and convince myself I have all sorts wrong with me, this time I’m convinced I have arthiritis. I’m only 22 so this doesn’t seem too likely and I’m wondering if it has more to do with the ED & over exercising. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
tips on how to get to a recovery headspace?,"Hi everyone, I’ve recently told my therapist about my eating disorder. We made a plan for recovering, including setting up times for me to eat and some mental reframing. However, I’m finding it really hard for me to accept wanting to recover.

What is a nutritionist for/like?,"Sorry, kinda random question here, but what exactly does a nutritionist do? Is there anything I should know before going into one? My therapist told me that I need to find one, but I don’t really know anything about them or what it would be like. What should I expect, going to one, in general? Sorry if this is irrelevant"
Meal plans and maintenance,"My dietitian said that nearly weight restored and once I am we can look at my meal plan and adjust it for maintenance. I’m perfectly fine with that, but I don’t know if she means eating more intuitively or eating less to maintain my weight… I’m scared of eating less though because I don’t want to start restricting again. Has anybody reached maintenance and if so, what happened to your meal plan?"
i feel hopeless and stuck,"possible tw just to be safe, this is kinda a vent/rant 

i remember three years ago when people would tire themselves out, wasting their breath trying to get me help. i didn’t want it and to me hearing “you look like you’re dying” was a win. it meant i was doing something right. no one cares at all now that i’ve gained weight. it’s not even a lot, but now that i’m just under a healthy bmi it doesn’t matter. i can skip meals for a couple days and restrict all the time and no one bats an eye. either they think my body is as disgusting as i think it is, or they’ve lost all hope in me getting better. i don’t think i’d blame them for either. i don’t believe in myself anymore. i want help, i truly do, but i don’t feel like i’m anywhere near mentally equipped to recover. the longest i can even half ass my recovery is three months and then it’s back to how it’s always been. seven years of my life i’ve spent fixated on food, even when i’m trying my hardest to recover. it never goes away for me. no matter how much i challenge myself with eating my fear foods, not logging my calories, journaling about how i feel, ranting to my therapist, and just about any other feasible recovery task under the sun. it never ever leaves my head. i’m just so tired of fighting myself all the time. things just felt so much easier when i would listen to that part of my brain. i had my routines and for scattered moments throughout everything i actually felt in control. i’ve never felt in control in recovery. i don’t want to relapse but i feel like the only thing that would change is what i eat, and i keep telling myself that it wouldn’t matter if that changed. because it wouldn’t to anyone else, and that’s the only thing that’s brought me to try to recover in the first place. i want to be comfortable going out and eating with family, to be more attractive to people, to not look so ashamed in the grocery store, at the dinner table or anywhere there’s food. looking back at recovery it’s never truly been for myself. i just don’t know what to do anymore. i think i’ll be moving relatively soon and all i can think of is how easy it’ll be for me to do what i actually want to again. to speed up this horrible process of this horrible disorder and let it kill me. maybe i wouldn’t let it get that bad, but maybe i would. maybe i’d finally feel like i’m doing something right for once. maybe this is all the stupid disordered part of my brain talking. i don’t know. i need help and i don’t know what to do to fix things, or if i even can. how do i make this stop?"
people who had ED’s….what were your “to-go” meals when you got hungry,"Hey Reddit fam! 👋 For all those who have experienced EDs, I totally understand how challenging and sensitive discussing food choices can be. But I also know that finding support and sharing experiences can be crucial on the road to recovery. So, if you're comfortable, i’d love to hear from you about your go-to meals when those hunger pangs hit! Remember, this is a judgment-free zone, and there's no right or wrong answer. Sharing your favorite meals might help others find inspiration or ideas for their own journey.

She’s 12 and has anorexia, she started a residential treatment today and it’s very hard to think about. Does any one have any tips on how I should help her? I want to become more educated on anorexia, on what she feels and how she sees herself. I would also appreciate any tips that worked on anyone who’s in recovery"
I did so well,"I did very well in recovery for a while.
Allowing me everything I want and not restricting.
However, suddenly I started to binge eat like crazy.
Like eating until I am in severe pain but still not stopping.
I'm no where near underweight anymore and this isn't physical hunger.
The past two days I consumed around 15k cals each day.
Do you think I gained a lot of fat by this? 
I'm freaking out.
Please help me."
Nausea before during and after eating?,I’m in the beginning of trying to recover and helping myself but I find that every time I go to eat I begin to get nauseous. And when i eat i still feel nauseous and either have to throw up or stop eating. I’ve been trying to google and nothing really gives me an answer. Is this normal? If it is what do I do about it? I hate this feeling and I want to recover quickly
A HUGE step in the right direction,"Yesterday I put both my scale and full-body mirror in hard to reach places and I’m so proud I did! I had been meaning to do it for months but the ED made me talk myself out of it every time. But now, it’s finally done!!!! It’s such a relief! I finally feel like I’m making progress :)))"
feeling uncomfortable and bloated,"yesterday i followed my meal plan, and today i woke up super motivated but now i feel very bloated and uncomfortable and it seems to me that it is too much what i have to eat and that i Will gain a lot, and i am already thinking about restricting....i feel really uncomfortable and i need some support, anyone in the same situation? :("
"Hi so rather than typing this out, I made a video explanation of why in early recovery/or during long term AN we experience massive bursts of energy that are too often mistaken as being cured/not sick anymore. This energy is a placebo and it's meant to actually get you to get food so you survive.",
How many of your doctors do you have to tell?,"So I ended up telling my mom and my therapist about this a little while ago, but now I have an appointment coming up in the morning with the doctor who prescribes all my medicines (can’t think of the name of that type of doctor rn), and my mom is pressuring me to tell him about my eating disorder. I only meet with him like once a month usually, and the appointment is over a video call, so I could prob get away without saying anything, and I really don’t know if I can or want to tell him about it on top of everyone else knowing too. But I don’t know if I should tell him. Any advice? I don’t know what to do, I keep going back and forth between the two."
muscle weakness and atrophy,"im sorry if this post might be stupid but i've been eating really a little this exact month (it was ok in june), wont be saying amount of kcals since its forbidden here but it was survivable, just way less than my body was used to get 

the thing is that ive started noticing how i got softer in a weird way and just way weaker in general which is obviously a muscular atrophy

now im trying to recover from this because i feel terrible both physically and mentally

and i cant even go to the doctor

any tips? i know i should eat more, especially food with protein, but should i also exercise? also how long does it take for them to recover? :( im very stressed and scared, i hope i have chances to gain my muscle back, im in desperate need to know if someone else had dealt with something like this."
weird day of eating: unsure what this is or where to go from here?? does this count as one of my meals??,"sorry if this violates any rules, im mostly typing this out to try and process it/get it straight in my head

so ive been in recovery for about a month now, and its been going mostly ok!! i will admit i still struggle with restricting and calorie counting, but ive been eating at maintenance at least half the time!! i know some people here will say thats not good enough but... baby steps, right??  
anyway today i was doing pretty normal for most of the day: i had my normal type of breakfast (although a bit earlier than usual, but i was determined not to let that bother me) and my normal lunch around midday, i even let myself have a snack pack of wafers right after lunch which is an improvement for me (i find snacking before mid-afternoon weirdly difficult still, but im working on it). so far so good!! 

at around 5, i felt hungry again, but it felt too early to make dinner (i eat with my flatmates a lot more nowadays and i knew they wouldnt want dinner til later) so i made myself a snack (rice cakes with cream cheese and ham, i know it kinda sounds like an ed meal but i was fully intending on eating again later). somehow though this just seemed to,,, open the floodgates, so to speak?? ive dealt with bingeing before in my ed (which is why i think it *could* have been one instead of ""oh youre in recovery its definitely just eh"") and im pretty sure ive experienced extreme hunger too, but somehow *this didn't feel like either???* in the space of around half an hour i ate  
\- another serving of rice cakes and ham  
\- two servings of soup (insane bc even before my ed i struggled to finish more than one)  
\- another two snack packs of wafers

immediately afterwards i felt really guilty, but i know i shouldnt bc 1) food guilt is BULLSHIT and 2) ive binged far, far more calories than this in the past lmao. the thing is, im not really sure how to classify this experience in my mind?? it kinda felt like the loss of control of a binge in that i kept going back for me, but with a sort of deliberate-ness to it that makes me hesitant to call it that?? at the same time like i said im pretty sure ive experience eh and there wasnt that same *ravenous* feeling to it. its like, i wasnt hungry past that first plate of rice cakes, but at the same time i was??

im sure i dont really even *need* to classify this at all, im just autistic and not having Names for experiences like this tends to freak me out. the guilt has pretty much passed now too, so im kinda just sat here wondering whether this still means im meant to make dinner or whether this counts as a meal because it's coming up on actual dinner time now and... well, for kinda self-explanatory reasons, im not really hungry anymore"
Question on meals …,"I’m looking for some easy ideas for meals (lunch and breakfast and snacks - I have to meal journal for my therapist). I have zero ambition to do anything complicated. Plus I find when I’m cooking the smells tend to “fill me” so it’s better if I eat quickly. 
I’m actually not that picky of an eater. But it’s just hard to know what to make. 
What are some go to meals/snacks for you?"
eating is hard :( lol,does anyone feel like eating is just so tedious. like i’m actually supposed to eat minimum three times a day?? feels like my last hump of recovery is being consistent and eating when it’s not really what i want to be doing in that moment. sometimes when i’m eating and i really don’t want to be my body tries to vomit and i have to almost tense up my actual stomach to prevent it? i’ve been making myself eat more when i don’t want to and this has been happening more and more
"Eating lots of ""unhealthy"" stuff",I've struggled with extreme hunger in the last few days and I can only think about sweets and cakes and stuff like that. I try to keep my meals and snacks balanced but especially in the afternoon I always get insane sugar cravings so I'll have a big slice of cake or something and usually at night I also have a sugary treat. I feel very guilty about eating so much sugar (that's something I'm trying to overcome) but I'm more concerned about the impact that the sugar has on my health. Is my fear justified or is it just eating disorder thoughts? Should I cut back on the sugar a little or wait until my cravings go away on their own?
"For those who are weight restored, do you genuinely like how you look like?","I'm afraid of drastic changes, especially if it's physical. Do you really change drastically or is it different for other people? The thought of it just makes me feel uncomfortable..."
What are foods you always have in stock?,"I just went grocery shopping and boy was it overwhelming. I tried to buy a couple options for snacks and meals but it was hard to know how many to buy. It’s difficult to build a base of things I should always keep in stock. I don’t know where to start!

As a rule of thumb, how many options do you usually have on hand? And if anyone is comfortable sharing, what are simple meal/ snack ideas you like to have? Also, if you have budget tips for recovery groceries I’m all ears"
"Lost, wrong perception","Hi all! 
If anyone did recovery and managed to restore weight and appetite, I would appreciate sharing meal plan with amount of food they had. Because I lost my perspective on what is too much or too little. I literally don't feel hungry after eating like little bit of bread, which is half slice. In my meal plans I should eat like xy g (x slices), along with other things like xyg of meat (chicken, fish, poultry, etc..).  egg is also enough, even though when I was in my high school I could easily eat x eggs along with bread and salads. If I see too much food on plate, I immediately get sick and can't even start eating. I feel satiated after few bites of anything. If it is against the rules to share numbers, dm me, or delete post, no hard feelings. 🙂"
How to return to a healthy relationship with the gym,"Hi everyone. As the title says, my question is related to returning to physical activity in a healthy way after years of compulsory behavior. If this is a sensitive area to the reader, I apologize and encourage you to not read on. I will give you a bit of back story in the hope of getting some help for my girlfriend who is currently battling her eating disorder.

My girlfriend (26F) of 3 years is currently battling an ED and the behavior around it, including exercise. She's getting professional help, and I, her family and close friends are included in the process. It's tough, but there is also progress. Of course, the treatment revolves around both psychological treatment and physical requirements to eat. Also, the health professionals encouraged my girlfriend to cancel her gym membership to stop her from upping her exercise volume in response to the increased energy intake and feelings around it. It's a tough decision, but she made it herself, which I am very proud of. She has been out of the gym for 4 weeks now. One issue is that she misses some of the people in the gym and the community there. We also used to go together, and we share quite a few friends there. It's a tricky situation as she misses going to the gym with me, seeing the people there, and also being social in general, as she is currently unemployed and feels stuck in the apartment. At the same time, some of the people in the gym trigger her ED behavior by the way they look or by their behavior (some of the girls there have openly discussed their EDs/recovery). 

My girlfriend really wants to start going to the gym again at one point. Most of the time she'll agree that it's too soon and that she has already learned a lot from not being ""forced"" to go there daily, not comparing herself to me when I go, and from seeing that her body is still fine after a few weeks away from lifting weights. Still, we'd like to eventually be able to go there together, and she'd like to be able to do physical activity again for the health benefits. But how can we safely plan this to minimize the risk of a relapse? We have discussed only exercising when it's a social thing, and/or setting a max limit of times she can go to the gym per week. Do any of you have any experience we can borrow? The health care professionals do not want to guide us on this, likely to not have any liability in case there is a relapse.

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend is taking time off from the gym to help her recovery from the ED. She wants to eventually return, but how do we minimize the risk of a relapse?

Lived experience of compulsive exercise in eating disorders,"Individuals with eating disorders often engage in exercise to control their shape and weight, or to regulate emotions. We are a team of researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia, and we are interested in a lived experience perspective on this topic. We are aiming to collect ideas about how to improve the experience of individuals with eating disorder regarding the assessment and treatment of exercise as an eating disorder symptom. 

  
The study should take between 30 and 60 minutes to complete, depending on the amount of information you choose to provide. Please note that you need to be 18 years or older to participate. Participation is entirely voluntary. Should you become distressed while completing the study, please contact your local helpline or health professional.

Anyways does anyone know if I can get rid of it other then lazer and shaving if you do pls help me out(cuz shaving every inch of your body is just really not duable for me lol)"
Fear food time,Probably one of the scariest fear foods for me. Restaurant pizza. Lets do this! 😳🎉
How to deal with parents planning my meals instead of me?,"I've been planning my meals for months now, I did gain. However, when I went on vacation for a family reunion, I lost an amount of weight. I found out yesterday as I had my monthly check-up. My doctor didn't do much. She was a bit disappointed and worried, but she reassured me to just consistently follow my meal plan (because during the vacation I kept skipping breakfast due to oversleeping).

It wasn't the same reaction towards my parents. They set new conditions:

1. I have to eat whatever they prepare (I can't completely prepare my meals) 

2. I have to eat snacks depending on my main meals (I'm not used to them even before my ED I never craved for snacks) 

I need help getting through this. I'm a bit worried because the food they usually prepare are processed, meat, rice, etc. (these are what I avoid - Asian household indeed). 

This is a bit rude and controversial, but it's also because I don't want to gain ""unhealthily"" because of those foods. My sister had an ED, she's weight restored now, but since she ate those foods...I'm not really sure if she gained the way she wanted to in the first place. I'm going crazy, maybe I'm just projecting my insecurities onto her. Please help."
AN Recovery and Neuropathy,"Hi friends,

Has anyone experienced neuropathy as part of their anorexia recovery? The outer part of my right thigh and my right calf is super sensitive to touch and certain positions, mostly sitting (with clothes pressing on them). I'm wondering if this has anything to do with insulin perhaps?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated."
Good morning,"Sending love to you all.  I am alone all day today.  Thank you for this sub.  I hope you spend your time today thinking about anything besides your weight.  No matter what you ate last night, no matter how your clothes fit today. I’m giving you permission to take the day off"
Dry brittle hair help,I’m trying to recover by at least eating around my maintenance but my hair doesn’t seem to regain its shine yet . It’s so dry and i keep applying oil treatments all the time but it gets dry not even an hour later . Does anyone have any tips to restore my hair’s health please? Any products that helped or hair masks ?
I just want to feel pretty in my clothes,"Possible TW (weight mentioned but not specifically + disordered urges)

I've been in recovery for the past year and a half. Recently I reached the weight I was 'pre-anorexica.' It's almost like whenever I buy new clothes that fit me, the next month point nothing fits *again.* And the whole time I look for new clothes I just berate myself. ""I'm just wasting money when this won't fit soon. I should do \[insert disordered behavior here\] so I don't have to keep buying new clothes. You won't look good in any of this'

 It's just also hard to accept my current weight as is, on top of nothing fitting me. I feel like the larger issue is my internal conflict with being fully weight restored but I just never feel pretty or good in any of my clothes anymore. It's really compelling to start dieting but I just have no trust in myself ;-; plus I'm at a healthy weight so I do think its my disorder telling me to diet. 

Anyone with similar experience or any support/advice to give would be amazing, feeling kinda alone. "
Will my body look this way forever?,"3 months into treatment (2 months residential, 3 weeks day program). Obviously my body looks different than it did when I was heavy in my ED. I’m trying to remind myself that this is the referring process and my body will level back out (to a normal weight)- but im beginning to lose hope. 

Others who have been through treatment and experienced the changes in your body- what is the long term process like?"
Any numbness/ swelling?,"I'm a month and a half into my recovery, however I've had some symptoms that I haven't seen anywhere else.
I feel like my skin is swelling. Especially in my neck and face, I've had blood tests done (only at a&e) and there's no sign if infection,or kidney failure ect. Nothing.
 my lymph nodes are a perfectly fine shape, except from a cankersore in my mouth that's so issue, I have no idea.
This has been going on since I started my recovery journey, but this feeling is only in my neck/cheeks.
I had 3 teeth removed in February of this year, but I highly doubt its that, I do have a doctors appointment booked. So please don't say to see the doctors aha.
Many thanks!"
Sleep-dependent hunger?,"Note: I don’t think this should be triggering (no numbers), but lmk if anything bothers you, and I’ll edit the post asap.

For context, my body is not super reliable when it comes to hunger cues (thanks, ED), so I pretty much eat on a meal plan that my dietician put together for me and have been for a few years now. There are times when it’s better or worse, but—generally speaking—I pretty routinely worms quite a bit of time eating when I’m not physically hungry. I’ve gotten used to it, for the most part, but 🤷‍♀️
The funny thing is, the only way that I’ve found to routinely “induce” an appetite throughout the day is sleep-depriving myself. If I get too little sleep one day (enough that I feel it physically ie little headaches, eye soreness, general exhaustion, etc), I get this feeling that I *think* is ravenous hunger that often doesn’t go away even after I’ve eaten a solid meal. This is great in terms of getting my food in comfortably, but it also kinda sucks because (a) in order to make this happen, I have to get little-enough sleep that it’s physically uncomfortable and (b) I have no idea what’s going on/whether this is actually “hunger” or just some weird mental thing (especially since I eat a very similar meal plan every day, so I know for a fact that I’m consuming a similar amount of energy). 

Has anyone else experienced this, or is it just another ~fun and funky~ quality of my brain? 🥲"
How do you go to a eating disorder clinic,I’ve been trying to recover for a while but I seriously think I will keep relapsing if i DONT have outside help I don’t know the requirements to go to one anyone who has went to one have you recovered and do you have advice for me?
Virtual PHP/IOP program recs,"I’m a 21 year old (female) struggling with anorexia and am currently over 20% below midpoint weight range. I had been feeling really invalidated because I don’t skip meals and have bad body dysmorphia so I never looked for help. I decided I can’t live like this anymore and am looking for treatment. I live on Long Island in New York and am really struggling with the idea of going res. I’m looking into virtual programs- PHP and IOPs and was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for ones that would be helpful as a first step. I do not currently have an RD or therapist, but I am being told I am past that point and need a collaborative program if not res. The ones I am looking into currently are MN (Monte Nido) virtual PHP & IOP, ERC (Eating Recovery Center) virtual IOP, and Equip. 
Has anyone done any of these programs? How were they? Or can anyone recommend any other PHPs or IOPs accessible from LI, NY (seems like the only ones are probably virtual) that accept insurance. I really appreciate the help!"
Relapse Help,"I thought I was mostly past my high school eating disorder. I still binged and then either restricted or exercised occasionally but I was fine? The pandemic destroyed me though. I gained a ton of weight for a bunch of medical reasons and now my brain is screaming at me to never eat again. To make things worse, my friend developed an illness that made them lose a ton of weight in the same period because they were literally incapable of eating. I can look at them and worry for their health, but at the same time, my brain thinks it's a great idea to ""follow that diet because it worked for them""."
How do I not calorie count?,"I recently got diagnosed, and after a lot of struggling and fighting with my s/o, I have accepted the fact that I have a problem.

My therapist told me I'm not allowed to count calories, but I'm finding extra hard since most packaging has the calories listed in big bold letters. Sometimes it's at the front of the packaging which makes it so much worse.

My S/O says I'm doing it on purpose to trigger myself, but I can't help it. Is there anyway to stop myself? Does anything help?"
can i recover without treatment?,i’ve been struggling with AN for years. i got out of an abusive relationship with my ex gf of four years almost a year ago. i’m with my family now and they’re not much better. my parents have always been mentally and emotionally abusive on top of my mom being an alcoholic and bipolar but we’re just supposed to ignore that. so there’s little to no support from my parents. my therapist has helped me a lot and we both agreed i need to go to residential treatment about a month ago. it’s coming up to my admission date and my parents are completely against it. i’m turning 26 in less than a month and i have been to treatment 3x’s already. the choice is either i ignore my parents and go to treatment for 2 months or i work my ass off trying to make money to provide for myself and don’t go to treatment. my therapist told me she won’t be able to see me anymore because apparently i’m not “medically stable” due to some of my recent bloodwork. i love her and i don’t want to lose her and at the same time i’m tired of letting my ed run my life. i also know that ignoring it and working won’t help me either. i don’t know what to do and i have 24 hours to decide. is recovery possible without me going to treatment again? i could use any advice right now.
Does anyone else get violently angry and sad when their meal is over?,"I just made myself a fried peanut butter sandwich for breakfast.  It’s so good, I’m about to finish it but the joy is so short lived! How do I move on from this delicious ness?  I want like 3 more sandwiches 🥪 😵‍💫🫣"
Vacation ?,"I planned to go to greece for a month and work there on a farm. I was all excited about it until I started to realise that it will completely throw me out of my comfort zone. 
I won't be able to exercise and I will have to eat what my host family serves . I saw pictures of some dishes and it looks all so delicious but not ""healthy"", they have pizza, cheese, lamb etc. 
I'm thinking about cancelling my flight because I'm so scared of gaining weight. 
I really don't know what to do."
OCD and eating disorders,"I was speaking with my psychiatrist today and we both kind of determined that my OCD is what started my eating disorder and realized that as  that has gotten better theough recovery, my OCD in other aspects has gotten worse. I just wanted to see if this something anybody else can relate to. I’d love to hear your experiences!"
"Treatment on Long Island, NY","I’m a 21 year old female and struggling with anorexia from Long Island, NY. Can anyone recommend a treatment program on LI? I’ve heard of Monte Nido Glen Cove and Mather Hospital PHP- has anyone done either of these? How was your experience? I would prefer a collaborative dietician/therapist or a day program but am having trouble finding ones. I appreciate any help!"
How long does is take until looking healthy again in Recovery?,"I lost a lot of weight over the past years, due to personal circumstances. And I hate it. I don't like seeing my ribs, having no tits, sick looking face, people making worriying comments about my appearance.
In January I weighed to less. Back then, I decided to not count calories and just to eat more and more frequently. Now its July and I only gained a little bit, still looking unhealthy and feeling small. So I decided yesterday that I have to count calories, at least until I am on a normal scale again. 

How long does it take until looking healty again? Especially my sunken face, my visible bones of my back when wearing a T-Shirt etc make me feel so uncomfortable. 
How long could it take for my body to distribute the calories I am taking in well if I make a plus of 500g per week?"
Misinformation From Another Sub,"From the mod of another sub who I will not name:  


""If you’re exercising instead of resting (like your body needs right now), then you’re more likely to overshoot. On top of that, it can prolong extreme hunger/elevated appetite, bloating, and water retention, and put you more at risk of injury. The body requires a lot of rest and if you’re constantly moving it, it’s not going to be able to heal fully.  
  
I’m not going to tell you what to do, but just be mindful that exercising during this time can increase the amount of weight you will gain in general in terms of set point as well, not just overshoot.""  


  
This. Is. Utter. Bulls\*it. There is \*no\* scientific evidence to back up this claim (on the contrary, strength exercises and light cardio are often recommended \*for\* eating disorder recovery - at least, in the U.S. and Canada)...although overshoot may happen (and shouldn't be feared), set point weight is variable (it's not ""my weight as an adult is destined to be exactly ""X"", and I can't change it"" - it's more so a range). This mod is seriously delusional."
"Rapid weight gain in first weeks of recovery - please help, is this normal?",I've started to really try to recover over the past 2 weeks - stuck to meal plan but also massive bursts of extreme hunger. I just made the mistake of weighing myself and I've gained a lot. More than I thought would be possible for only 2 weeks. Is it normal to rapidly gain weight when you start recovery? Will it slow down? Feeling scared and fighting the urge to restrict and compensate..but I know thats only going to make everything worse 
Why do I keep gaining??? I fucking hate my life. Is recovery a scam????,"I thought as long as you are enough, 3 meals every day, 3 snacks, one would stop gaining weight when being healthy. But why am I getting fat???? I knew I had to gain weight, but I thought as long as I did not overeat and stayed active I would still be small. 

But just now I tried on some pants a size bigger than what I used to wear, and they felt thight… does that mean I have gained two pant sizes??? 

I’ve been fat before, slightly overweight according to BMI. I can’t go back there. I rather kill myself."
Food hoarding: feeling like it's the last day on earth,"Idk how to explain this but I kind of have this feeling like it's my last day on earth and that makes me hoard food. For example, I went shopping for a tiny get-together with two friends yesterday and I got 5 different kinds of chips, cookies, chocolate, marshmallows, dipping sauces, candy bars but also many other things like waffles and cheese and I only realized how much food I bought when I went to the cash register. Things like that happen to me all the time, my pantry is full of snacks and sweets and cereals and I also have some stored in my closet because I feel this compulsion to always have enough food at home. Does anyone else struggle with food hoarding? I feel like I'm going insane 😭"
has anyone been more protective over food?,"so since starting my recovery i have been a lot more defensive of my food and drinks. and it has caused me to be more sensitive. .. like i get upset when people take like a fry from my plate . (i do not get aggressive i just get sad and upset). especially if its a safe food. 

i am completely fine if its like a sip of water but if its a soft drink or something that isnt a snack, like a bowl of pasta, i get anxious to the point of where ill move my food and drink closer.


is this a normal thing? or am i just being weird?"
How to stop lapses,"I'm an athlete, I love sports, I lift, I'm a pretty physically active person without my bad habits. I'm trying so hard to eat consistently but it is so easy for me to forget, and I don't know if I'm really forgetting or if it's self-sabotaging at this point. I usually don't notice until my hair starts falling out again and then I'm back at my low point again. How do I prevent it? Is it possible too? Or is this the entire recovery, and process of it."
Tw: quesion on why restricting helps this way?,"I dont have anorexia, but I do struggle with restricting food sometimes and apparently there is no ""disordered eating"" thread so I figured I would post here. 

Im depressed, and sometimes when I restrict it almost seems like my mood gets better, but then when I finally eat again I have this desire to cry, even though I don't. 

I dont have body image concerns attached to my restricting (hence not anorexia) but it is a control or emotional expression thing for me

. I don't understand why the eating seems to pull my mood back down and wondered if anyone knew?!."
Girlfriend with anorexia,"Could anyone give me tips to help my girlfriend who has anorexia? I just wanna know anything I could do to help because I am very supportive of her but I also try to get her to eat which is against her wishes. She has it pretty bad (stomach pains from not eating) and it worries me beyond belief. When I first heard of anorexia, I thought that if I ever met someone with it I could help them with self encouragement/motivation so that they won’t care what others think, but I’ve been thrown for a loop with my girlfriend. She hates her legs because she thinks they’re fat. I use every type of reasoning to get her to see it differently but nothing seems to work. Any tips and ideas would be very much appreciated, thanks"
Possible refeeding syndrome?,"Has anyone else experienced refeeding syndrome while recovering? If so, what were the symptoms? 

I think it might be something I’m experiencing but I don’t know. I feel really shaky and out of breath when I eat normal sized portions. I don’t know what’s going on. It’s really scary. I’ve mentioned it to my doctor but she just said that refeeding only effects how much you poop but I don’t think that’s accurate. I don’t think she understands eating disorders. I can’t see any other doctor because she’s the only one in my area that’s in network with my insurance and there aren’t any eating disorder programs or therapists in my area that I can ask."
"Exercise, like and dislike","Several years into recovery, I still hate the idea of regimented exercise. Walking is fine, stretching/yoga is ok, but the thought of having to go to the gym again makes me feel ill. Anyone have similar thoughts? I want to be able to enjoy activity without fall-diving back into the compulsive aspect of mvmt (esp cardio)."
I'm in recovery... Right?,"So I started recovering from an in March of this year and it's been a bit weird. Around May, I started restricting sloooowly because the weight gain freaked me out. 

The funny thing is, I became more physically active after starting recovery. Also, from May, ie 2 months into recovery, I started hrt testosterone (I'm a trans man). So now, I'm literally inhaling food. Especially protein, because for some reason, I'm only craving high protein stuff. Maybe it's the testosterone? 

My main question comes here: I got into road biking and go longer each week. It kinda sparks the competitive side of me, in a negative way. I even walk loads of steps or in case I don't, I make sure to hit my daily goal. But I'm eating ""healthy"" foods because like I mentioned, I'm only craving for the same. 

Am I recovering? There's 2 sides to it cause I still long for that skinny body that I had this time last year but I know very well that it didn't serve me well and I was sooo miserable. Now, I'm actually feeling amazing and genuinely grateful/optimistic. Also, the hrt has been helping me too. 

But I'm afraid of relapsing because it sends me back to the self-harm loop and honestly, I don't wanna deal with it anymore. 

So is the cycling and steps coming in my recovery? I also do some strength training. 

If you made it till here, thank you :)"
"Avoid The...""Other"" Subreddit","As the title says, a lot of us have been manipulated/shut down by the moderator of another subreddit dedicated towards eating disorder recovery (in name). The moderator has no credentials besides her own experience, and gaslights vulnerable individuals into questioning their recovery through wordplay and victim-blaming. I strongly recommend against browsing/posting there - if you're looking for recovery resources, I'd first and foremost recommend actual medical professional, but in regards to the Internet, don't take recovery advice from one person who clearly shows signs of a compulsive need for control (I mean, can you truly be recovered if you spend nearly all your time responding to eating disorder Reddit posts? That's essentially her entire personality)  


From one of her recent posts:  


""Regarding medical advice, I do think it’s important to point out that not all medical professionals know about eating disorders and do in many instances offer disordered advice. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t listen to them if you think that’s best, but there’s also no harm in telling members to be cautious due to how percasive diet culture is, even in the medical field.""  


  
....this is incredibly dangerous advice...""you shouldn't listen to your doctor b/c they're projecting diet culture and fatphobia"""
I am finally committing to recovery,"I have spent the last year and a half in ""recovery"" from anorexia and to be honest I have been lying to myself. I told myself that if I just gained the minimum amount of weight and ate a few more foods that I had been avoiding then it would be fine.

It is not fine.

Yesterday was my little sister's  birthday. I did not eat breakfast with her like I would've done before my eating disorder. I went to the gym instead of doing something with her. I did not eat her birthday cake or go to the family lunch. In the evening I sat in my room, alone, and cried because she wanted us to have dinner together. She has not mentioned it but I know she heard me crying and I hate myself for it. My mum came in and practically begged me to come and eat with her and my sister. And you know what? I did it. 

We ordered food and ate as a family. And nothing bad happened. I am filled with self hatred right now for letting anorexia rule my actions. If I could go back I would do all the things my sister wanted me to do with her and I hate that I can't. 

But something snapped in my head in that moment and I realised that even if a tiny part of the anorexia was allowed to live in my head then it would find away to keep digging its claws in until I relapsed properly. Anorexia has no place in my life any longer. 

I am so scared of recovery and my heart feels like it's  about to explode.

But there is something scarier than recovery. I never want my sister to worry about what she eats or how much she weighs, I never want her to feel like I do and I never want her to miss out on a birthday with me again. That thought is scarier than recovery. 

So, this is your sign. Let's recover properly. No more excuses. "
Nausea Solutions?,"I am always feeling sick, particularly in the morning or during a workout or if I do anything too fast. I am trying my best to eat normal sized meals but with my ADHD and panic disorder I will either forget to eat or wait too long so then i’m too nauseous to think about eating. I really want to push through the nausea because I know it’ll make it go away but how do you get over that initial panic and anxiety of trying to eat when you feel sick? I get so scared of being nauseous that I won’t eat altogether, and I want to fix this so I can enjoy the food and not be miserable all the time.

TDLR: whats the best way to push through nausea so I can eat full meals?"
kind of having a laspe,"recently i started feeling really bad abt my body and decided to go on a weight loss journey. i wanted to lose fat and build muscle, even tho i know i dont  need to, im a normal/healthy weight. this was  just my solution to dealing with my insecurities.  ive been calorie counting and going to the gym and im starting to think this isnt good for me, since i just weight restored and finished treatment. but i also really love how i feel seeing myself drop a little weight.    im not restricting too much or over exercising so i know this isnt rlly gonna affect my health. but it might affect me mentally. im not sure what to do."
Reasons to recover,"I’m having a little bit of a tough weekend, and it helps to remind myself of why I’m putting in the effort to recover. I know that I’m moving toward a better life, but the tough moments are tough. Please share your current motivations to recover, big or small. I need some inspiration for the hard days 💙

A few of mine: 
- Enriching my friendships
- Being able to say “yes” to spontaneous lunch dates
- Feeling warm in the winter
- Finally letting my best friend teach me her favorite recipes
- Traveling to new places and trying the local food
- Freeing up brain-space!!!!!!
- Snuggling up on the couch with a book on rainy days
- Having the energy to pursue my education
- Letting someone else choose the restaurant and knowing that I’ll be just fine
- Finding mental peace someday

 A lot of these feel very far away…if anyone has found little joys on their recovery journey lately (or if you have big goals you’re working toward), I’d love to hear them :)"
Omg I just had butter on bread for the first time in years,"I only really noticed now how much I restricted even before my eating disorder developed because I can't remember the last time I had buttered bread. I feel so relieved now, it was a huge challenge for me to have buttered bread and I panicked about it all evening because I planned to have buttered bread for breakfast but it was soooo worth it. I can't wait to be healthy again and actually see food as something to enjoy but facing my fears and actually managing to eat extreme fear foods is already such a relief ♥️ it's scary to give up habits and face my fears but the thought of being ill forever is even scarier so SCREW IT!!!"
feeling guilty... again,"today I ate a lot. mostly because i went to a party eith a lot of food available, to I jsut... had a lot. 

idk if this is allowed in the sub, but a warning just in case. i started the day having a plum and a large cheese omelette (8am, a really normal breakfeast for me) and at 11:30, before going to the party, cause i didnt want to be overly hungry when I got there, i had an apple and a small yogurt bowl of blueberry yogurt, nuts and granola.

at the party itself, at roughly 13:30, i started eating some small deep-fried usual party foods we have here in brazil - a coxinha, a risole, a cheese stick and I think something else? idk i cant really remember. but when i had these things, i wasnt even hungry, just felt like it. and a bit later, maybe 14:15, they were serving pasta, and i had a bowl-full of cappellettis with white sauce, cheese and a filling i couldn't wuite identify...

then, by 15:00, they served cake and i had a slice of chocolate cake, a cake pop and a brigadeiro.

im going to have dinner real soon but im feeling so guilty abiut it all. im a bit hungry now but i felt wuite full for a while and i dk if i ate a lot or if my ed is judt tricking me."
New mindset,"*MAY BE A TRIGGER WARNING SORRY IN ADVANCE* 

Before and during my Ana high I would get so jealous of thin size zero girls on tv. I wish I was like them and wonder how they keep there figures. For a hot min the dream came true and I could fit into 0 shorts (and I wasn’t even stick thin) then I got diagnosed with Ana and my life became a battle of food. Now after being recovered and learning about the disease and about food I know they arnt healthy and every time I see them now I get grossed out and it motivates me not to be like that"
Giving yourself days where you just listen to your extreme hunger?(TW?),"Is it a good thing to do so?
I had a celebration for my graduation with my family so I wanted to let myself eat whatever I could think of.
I ate a pastry with jam, a lot of bbq, 3 1/2 slices of cake, 2 ice creams, burger, corn on the cob, and a deep fried pastry with nutella, it seems a bit excessive, and I'm scared that I might develop a binge eating disorder, I need some opinions since I don't know how to feel"

TW i’m scared of my old eating habits coming back,"(tw if sensitive about negative thoughts) okay so before my anorexia, food was my comfort. i did it because i was bored/lonely/depressed (still all of those things) since i just moved to a new place but never saw it as a problem. i only noticed it when i saw the other girls at my school which led me to my ed. unfortunately the ed took over everything so the year i could’ve been trying to make friends, i focused on food. i liked food, i always have, even when i wasn’t sad and lonely. but now that i’m gaining weight in recovery, i’m worried that i’ll have nothing to go back to except feeling like an ugly person with no social life who always eats. did anyone else go through this issue? i could really use some tips"
im so tired of struggling w ana (TW),"I just feel so out of energy, i fell asleep in the afternoon for hours. most people my age would have so much energy to spare but im asleep for 4 hours. I also had a dream during this dream this sentence i was made me so emotional. Someone from my family told me ""I'd rather be live then be pretty"" its so hard for me to recover but ive said so many times that id rather live a healthy and happy life i just nee to figure out how to recover first."
captain crunch,"last night, i had a GIANT bowl of milk and cereal. i put milk before cereal and i filled it to the top and grabbed massive handfuls of captain crunch and stabbed it into my milk. cow milk!! so many handfuls of cereal. i probably ate half the bag. i listened to my body. i’d just eaten dinner too. i was so happy. i snuggled up and watched a movie while eating it. and then this morning, i had a breakfast bowl with weetabix, yogurt, almond butter, and BANANA!! there were so many other toppings but the banana: oh. my. god! 
i’m so happy and so proud of myself. we’re on a road trip so now i’m just sitting here with a full, happy tummy. i just wanted to share this <3"
Dealing with Food Intolerances in Recovery,"I’ve struggled with an ED for about 8 years now, but I felt like i was finally in a good recovery spot where I was eating balanced, wasn’t restricting, and finding movement without over exerting myself. 

I have found myself in the last few weeks/months though very reactive to dairy, so much so that I had to cut it out entirely. I also have severe endometriosis, and the more I monitored my symptoms and read studies, it seems gluten is particularly inflammatory to my body and my disease/symptoms. 

I feel so frustrated finally being at a place where I don’t want to restrict anymore, but facing these heavily restrictive dietary intolerances. It feels like some big cosmic joke. I guess I’m just venting, but if anybody can relate or has support or advice, it would be appreciated."
I want to recover for good,"I guess this is hard for me to admit but I haven't ever truly recovered. When I'm hungry I'm mean and unpleasant. But I can't break the habit for good. I lash out at people often because my hormones are all over the place. I don't know what makes me feel guiltier sometimes. I just want to recover for good, to be able to eat whatever I want guilt-free, to avoid thinking about numbers, and to stop thinking about all of it in general. It doesn't help that my best friend is also struggling with anorexia and refusing to seek help, I love her so much but it triggers me when she mentions numbers or her behaviors. I don't want to drop her because I also worry about her as well. I've been trying my best to recover but i realize I'm only ever doing good when I'm feeling pressured to eat more. I grew up in a household where food is a major love language whether that be through buying or sharing snacks, buying each other our favorite foods, eating our favorite meals together, or having fruit together. food is major and I want to be able to partake in my family's love language without feeling bad about calories. I want to recover for good for my family, my friends, and most of all for myself. I want to be the best person I can be and that won't be able to happen if I have this weighing me down for the rest of my life. Living like this doesn't feel like living at all for me, I want to live not just survive. I need some help and a bit of support but I feel like there's no one I can go to so I'm here. But I will definitely get to recover for good someday. This was a long post so thank you for reading <3"
Anyone else have random bouts of excessive hunger?,"I have been in recovery a long time, over 1.5 years but I’d say I’ve only gotten really solid in my approach and consistency as well as my not giving a shit about “getting fat” in the last 6 months or maybe 8 months.
So I already went through the beginning and extreme hunger and being up all night because hungry and needing to eat. 

But I will still have a night like that like once a month. Where even if I seemingly ate enough during the day, bam, can’t sleep. Eating is the only solution. I mean it’s 4 am and I’m dealing with that right now.

Anyone else have this? I figure it’s normal and the body has some good reason for it, something probably to do with healing or stress."
does insomnia go away eventually?,ok so i am writing this because i CANNOT fall asleep without my 4 melatonin pills and chamomile tea and it’s lowk very annoying. i basically feel tired 24/7 but when i try to take naps and sleep i just can’t i stay in like a half awake state and does nothing to help. can anyone else relate/know any solutions?
The fear is getting stronger,"I am getting more discouraged.
I read anorexia recovery blogs on the internet
What I don't understand is...
Is it mandatory to be obese first for weight restoration?
For example, I am 150 cm do l have to be higher weight from my height?

Can someone help?"
Struggling with recovery weight gain distribution,"I put TW because I don’t want to discourage anyone from recovery but just air my grievances I guess and see if anyone is going through something similar/has any words of reassurance.

Essentially, although I know it’s something that will balance out in time, l feel like the way my weight is redistributing as I enter the weight restoration zone is making things 10x harder. Theoretically, I’m now at the point in recovery when being this weight is something I can tolerate and am increasingly coming round to, which is huge considering how terrifying it was to me when I started treatment. What I can’t deal with though is just how fucked up the places this weight seems to go is and how uncomfortable it is making me in my body.

For starters, my stomach is huge. Not as in chubby but as in CONSTANTLY bloated looking, unless I eat restrictively for days at a time which I obviously don’t want to do. And I feel bloated too? Pretty much all the time. My stomach feels sensitive to everything I eat.

Randomly, my lower legs seem pretty much perpetually swollen too to the extent where wearing ankle socks leaves marks. Don’t even get me started on my face. I’ve always had chubby cheeks but previously when I reached this weight in the early phase of my anorexia (my HW was a lot higher still than my weight restoration goal, I didn’t receive any treatment until I was in the depths of it which is probs the same for most unfortunately), I remember being happy because I could finally see something resembling actual bone structure in my face, lol! But now, it’s like I look puffier and softer and rounder?? I guess?? Is the way to describe it?? In all the areas I know I didn’t when my weight was in this region on the way down:( and now I just feel swollen and crappy all the time, literally like I’ve been pumped up with air. It sucks. I want to recover and I’m okay with this weight but my self-confidence is fucked:("
Has anyone managed to balance their hormones through recovery?,I’m so sick of not having a period and all of my hair falling out… I have only a quarter left of what it used to be and my scalp is very dry/flakey and inflamed. So sick of being this way…. I need some hope
My boyfriend cheated on me,"And I need to move next month but everything is too expensive and I’m exhausted, gaining weight of course but I don’t even care, there’s a swollen lymph on the side of my face so I probably have cancer, I’m a 34 year old ugly dumb women that no one wants to be around .  I wish I had the courage to k ms, my life is absolutely meaningless"
Tw-mention of certain behaviors,"I hope this is allowed in here but I need some help/advice, I will not mention any numbers or specific descriptions but this post will be about purging behaviors so please be aware if that triggers you

I've only recently started recovery and it's been such a distressing time for me. All I can think about is burning off the calories to be in a deficit again and I can hardly sit still. After every bigger meal (I try to have ""normal"" amounts for lunch and dinner, plus a small breakfast and small snacks throughout the day) and every time I feel full I feel an intense compulsion to purge or exercise to get rid of it and it drives me crazy because I know I need to gain weight but the disordered part of my brain won't shut up. Should I increase exercise and also increase my food intake? Did anyone else struggle with this and have a solution?"
Terrified of recovering but also terrified of continuing,"TRIGGER WARNING - suicidal thoughts

Hi everyone, I’ve recently had an anorexia diagnosis. I’ve also been told I have anaemia and a b12 deficiency, partly because of my ED and partly because I’m vegan. I was vegan for years before I had an ED so it’s not restrictive behaviour, just putting that out there!

I’m so fed up of living this way. The constant brain fog, the exhaustion, not being able to just EAT or live normally. I’m fed up of everyone walking on eggshells around me and I’m fed up of feeling suicidal and like the world will be better off without me. I hate living this way and I want more than anything to feel like me again.

However, I’m so unbelievably terrified of eating normally, I’m so scared of putting weight on and try as I might, I can’t stop the calorie counting/restricting and compulsive daily exercising. I don’t like how I look, I’m 25 and have the build of a scrawny 12 year old, I don’t feel sexy in the slightest. My hair is falling out, I haven’t had a period since March, I can’t sleep and I’m so snappy with everyone.

I’m also cabin crew and have been told because my blood pressure and pulse were so dangerously low, I’m unfit to fly until they improve. This has completely knocked me as my career is my world, I’m so annoyed I have ruined it for myself.

My doctor is being amazing but I’m still waiting on the ED referral to happen, no idea how long it will take because of the NHS strain.

I have been seeing an amazing man recently who I really like and makes me super happy, I’m scared my behaviours and tendencies will get on his nerves one too many times and he’ll decide he wants a woman who eats and behaves like a normal human.

I bargained with myself I will reverse diet until I’m at a maintenance amount of calories but this is still restrictive and I keep reverting back to going below my calorie allowance for the day, so I’m aware this isn’t helpful or advised.

I really don’t know what to do or what I’m looking for posting this but I know I can’t go on like this. Tips/advice/support/anything PLEASE."
How long until you feel ok doing normal things?,"I understand each person will vary. But based on your personal experience, how long was it before you didn’t feel exhausted/particularly achey from doing normal things?"
What is extreme hunger?,"
People who recovered from anorexia mentions this a lot..
I am recovering with the help of therapy. 
I used to not eat
 My condition is not very serious but I lost my period 
Now, for a short time, I started to maintain weight with the control of my weight psychiatrist and dietitian. 
But of course I will start gaining weight very soon. I didn't feel very hungry the first time I ate and it's the same now.
 But will this happen to me when I start gaining weight? 
This scares me... I don't want to have binge eating. 
This takes my courage  away...

Can someone help me?"
Does anyone know why weight gain can be seen more in the face?,"Since starting recovery and beginning to restore weight, I’ve noticed it happen in my face and stomach way more than anywhere else. I understand the stomach, as it’s to protect vital organs, but is there any reason it happens in the face as well?"
I need help stopping compulsive movement (TW),"Ik it’s a rule not to say numbers so I won’t, but I’m in semi-recovery sort of, and I have an issue with compulsive walking that’s pretty much consumed my life lol. I don’t know how to stop. It’s gotten to the point where I get anxious sitting for longer than a couple hours and I spend most of my day walking in circles. I woke up this morning after having a conversation with my mom where I said I’d try to just stop, but the sheer thought of stopping made me so anxious that within a couple hours of waking up I got up and started walking for >!5!< hours straight. It doesn’t help that I’m not working or in school rn for obvious reasons so I don’t have much to fill my day. I just don’t know how to begin

Edit: some additional information, I see a dietician who specializes in ed’s who very hesitantly still sees me bc I’m an adult and she can’t force me to go to treatment, and she set me a step/calorie goal. The calories are easy but the step goal is so far below what I currently get and I just don’t know how to get it down."
I’m feeling recovered.,"I got fed up of feeling sick and cold all the time and the past few months I’ve made an effort to eat more and reduce stress. I’m gaining and not feeling that guilty about it. I figure people don’t really care about it anyways, and should I really care about what other people/stramgers think? 

My period disappeared again though but otherwise I feel like my thoughts are not dominated with thinness and food. 

Not sure if this feeling will last. I’m also not diagnosed with an ED so I wonder if I ever had one. 

Edit: My period came back lol"
How fast do I have to go into recovery?,"So I think I’m gonna try to recover, but I have no clue where to even start. I met with a therapist and we talked about it some, but we didn’t have much time and only see each other once a week, so I’m not quite sure where to go from here. How do I start, and how fast do I have to go into this?
Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just have no clue what I am supposed to do"
recovering girlfriend,"my girlfriend is starting to recover and doing pretty good, she says she only eats for me which I am happy about- mainly grateful she is eating, though some days she says she just can't do it. I've never had eds, still, I can understand how hard this is for her, but I'm wondering if I should set this boundary that she has to eat at least twice a day, or if I should help her recover in her own time?"
Is it normal to get stomach cramps in recovery?,"I’ve had the worst cramps of my life for two days now and nothing will make them go away. 
For context I’m 19 and not on my period (nor have I had one for a good few months). I’m eating “normally” which by that I mean I’m eating about double the amount the average person does.
Anyway I want to know if this is a symptom of recovery or something entirely unrelated.

Thanks for your help!
Don’t forget to fuel your body today xx"
I have a theory about anorexia,"So I really don't know where to post this but I really feel like I need to tell it to someone. Not sure if this is anything revolutionary (propably not). But as I'm recovering from anorexia and am also a biology student this topic really interests me. Note: I'm not an expert, this is just an opinion.

So my theory is this: I don't think anorexia is as much of a mental illness as it is thought to be. I believe it's actually more so a physical problem that causes mental symptoms.

There doesn't seem to be a certain personality type to develop it. Really the one thing that seems to trigger it is a calorie deficit, whatever the cause of that may be. So I think that it's actually the body's natural starvation response that turns against you because of the environment and social pressures that we face.

If you look at the mental symptoms of anorexia and compare those to the symptoms of starvation they overlap a lot. Which makes sense but where as in famine those symptoms (anxiety, preoccupation with food, restlesness) would have driven us to seek out food, now they turn against us. Because we have access to calorie information, scales and social pressure to be thin, that obsessivenes and food preoccupation actually creates a perfect scenario where this illness can happen.

The numbers (calories, weight etc.) are what your brain starts to obsess over when it's in a state where it's already prone to obsessivenes, especially around food. And the more you restrict the worse these symptoms get because of the worsening starvation. Your body is basically doing everything it can to get you out of the famine but under modern surcumstances it just makes things worse.

The thing that really started my recovery was reading a study linking the restlessness and compulsion to exercise (symptoms of anorexia) to something called ""the migration response"". A lot of animals have this, basically when the calories you eat drop too low your brain sends you a signal to migrate. This would have helped our ancestors travel to find food. But again, now it works against us. Exercise was a really big part of my illness so this really helped me understand why I was having these symptoms. (Couldn't find the study but here's a link to an explanation of the theory:
 https://www.livlabelfree.com/blog/anorexia-and-hyperactivity-explained-adapted-to-flee-famine-hypothesis-part-5

Another interesting thing is that body dysmorphia is seen in starvation in general, not just anorexia. I remember reading about this study of concentration camp victims who were asked to describe their appearance and they would use words like ""voluptuous"".(Couldn't find the source for this one either right now, sorry.) So it's clear that starvation affects your body image.

What really proved this all to me was when I cut out all exercise and started to let myself eat as much as I wanted, those symptoms suddenly started to disappear very quickly. Things I thought were parts of my personality were suddenly just gone. I never would have classified myself as the ""type"" to develop anorexia and now that I'm not starving I still wouldn't. Infact it blows my mind that I ever had it, I can't relate to my anorexic self at all now. 

Anyway, don't know if this is something that's already a popular theory and been told a million times. But thinking about things from the perspective of biology was the most helpful thing to me in recovery, so I hope it might help someone else too. Just a reminder that I'm not an expert and this is just my take on things."
what are peoples opinions on weight training while in recovery,"i’ve been lifting for a few months and it’s helped me immensely, but i’m worried it’s just replaced the anorexia thoughts and i’m not actually healing. i don’t want to stop lifting because it brings me so much joy but i don’t want to put a dent in my progress"
Here comes the heat,"As someone who is typically bundled up in average to warm temperatures….getting waves of feeling warm/hot feels so strange! Lol
One night I picked up a thing of frozen veggies from the fridge to try to sleep with."
Eating extreme fear foods with others,I have some foods that I'd never touch if i was alone and yesterday I had a panic attack over such a food but today I went to the lake with some friends and I ate those fear foods without any physical reactions. Usually I start shaking or crying but it was just the usual food guilt afterwards. This makes recovery very hard right now because I always need someone to kind of watch me when I eat which of course is not possible. Does anyone else lose their fear of certain foods during social events or when eating with others? For me it feels like I only eat to show others that I'm really trying hard to get better but I can't enjoy anything when I'm alone 😭 any advice?
recovered and entering a relationship with someone with an active ed,"i started recovering fairly recently, almost a year ago, and have been doing really well. i recently started seeing this girl and we have so many similar life experiences and understand each other almost naturally, including when it comes to our eating disorders, which we found out we shared early on. she was honest with me in telling me that she is still struggling and as we cooked together and shared meals on our dates i noticed a lot of behaviors and fears i used to have. i feel like i have so much experience and advice and help and encouragement to provide and i don't believe i will relapse. i think this connection could be positive for the both of us. at the same time i worry about putting energy into helping her since she's had her ed since childhood while ive only struggled for a few years, and what that might mean for a relationship dynamic. what gives me hope is she has been eating more while we've been together since i have been open about how i overcame my own struggles and discomfort with certain foods, and have been eating those foods in front of her. i think i can see us having a really good connection if we continue dating, but im scared of codepency issues as well. i dont want to encourage any behaviors by being too understanding. i just really like her and also empathize with her a lot. ive dated other people with disordered eating and have always been pretty strong in my boundaries to eat whether the other person is or isnt, pre ED and now after. but this feels different because our pasts are so similar and our connection is very strong, i am wondering if anyone has been in a similar position or has advice about going about this. if this sounds like a glaring issue, i'd like to hear that perspective as well. thank you!"
Was your extreme hunger physical or mental,I’m finding my stomach GROWLING after a meal. Like HUNGRY HUNGER. And I do not crave any specific food. I just know I need to eat food to stop the hunger. Is everyone’s extreme hunger also physical? I feel so shameful tbh bc I eat so much. I had two breakfasts and stomach is still growling
Food guilt,"I once again started recovery.

I´m not able to eat ""unhealthy"" or food from other people , so I´m cooking for myself.

The point is that I\`m scarred of many foods because they aren\`t filling enough. Every time I´m trying something new for dinner , I get hungry  soon again. I know that I should eat more but it just feels so wrong to eat not whole grain or high proteine foods because I dont want to be hungry every 2 hours.

But the food guilt kicks in the worst when Im eating before going to bed . It feels kinda u nnecessary .

Can someone tell me how to overcome this food guilt?

Is it right to eat none filling food like noodles or white bread on a daily basis? 

Is it right or good to eat short time before going to bed?

&#x200B;

thanks for every answer , I feel like Im going insane"
Happy fourth of July to mAmerican friends! 🇺🇸🎆 Just remember…,"A big meal or extra snack DOES NOT replace anything. No matter what breakfast, lunch, or dinner was, no matter if you had more snacks than usual, you still need your next meal or snack just like every other day. 

If your family ate less than 3 meals today, did not snack, only snacked, skipped dessert, or anything else lie that, that is not a reason for you to do the same. You are recovering from eating disorder, they are not.

Love yourself, honor your body, and be gentle with yourself.

You’ve got this!"
Shadow Bread: Baking Your Way to Food Freedom,"Hey everyone!

I wanted to share a special video with all of you. I recently embarked on a journey that has not only helped me heal but has also brought immense joy to my life. In the spirit of celebration and growth, I'd like to present my bread making video.

In this video, I take you through the  process of making a very unique homemade bread from scratch. It's more than just a recipe; it's a symbolic representation of my recovery journey and the beauty of rediscovering a healthy relationship with food. 

For those of us who have struggled with eating disorders, engaging in activities that promote positive associations with food can be immensely empowering. Creating something tangible and nourishing with our own hands can help us reconnect with the joy and pleasure that should be inherent in the act of eating.

I hope this video can serve as a source of inspiration and encouragement for anyone in this community who may be seeking solace, support, and creative outlets in their recovery journey. Remember, we are all on this path together, and by sharing our experiences, we can help uplift and inspire one another.

Please take a moment to watch the video, and if it resonates with you, I would be grateful for your feedback, comments, and personal stories. Let's continue to support each other and celebrate the triumphs, big and small, as we navigate the path to recovery.

Sending love and healing vibes to all of you!

AN Recovery and Body Aches,"Happy 4th of July for those in the US.

I'm 5 months into AN recovery. I've been weight restored for 3 months per my dietician  - apparently I'm the quickest gainer she's ever seen 🥴.

Could anyone else who has made it this far in recovery share a little about their experiences with physical pain and body aches? Maybe duration and places where your aches were especially bothersome?

I'll start. The first 2 months, my stomach was sensitive to the touch. The 2nd two months, lower back was the same. For the past month, I've my thighs and calves are sore as heck, especially sitting in my office chair 8 hours a day.

Any feedback would be appreciated and make me feel like this is perhaps normal at this point. For some context, I'm a 34yo male, so maybe my body won't bounce back as fast as the spring chickens, especially after a decade of restriction.

Many thanks in advance. <3"
6 months still no hunger cues,I been in recovery for 6 months and I still don’t have hunger cues. Did any one else also take a long time for them to come back? it makes eating really hard.
it gets so much better❤️,"just deleted mfp after 3 years with that bitch. wanted to unalive myself more times than i can count. but who cares what your gravitational pull to the earth is. it changes from minute to minute. who cares how many calories you eat a day. it’s only an estimate anyways. i used to read people’s “it gets better” posts and think it would never be me. so take this from the girl who thought it would never ever get better for me as a sign to keep fighting because it gets so so much better, i promise."
ED clinics and mandatory “family involvement”,"This is half a question and half a vent post. Obviously nobody can tell me what my clinic specifically would do but if anybody has info on what is standard, personal experiences, or words of advice, i would appreciate it.  

i’m 16 and want to start recovery. 

I’m seeing my doctor next week and i’m 99% sure i can get a referral to my closest ED clinic. I’ve gotten one before but just lied until they left me alone. 

However, i’ve looked at what the treatment entails and it seems like EVERY clinic (inpatient/outpatient/whatever) makes you eat with your family as part of the program. They call it the maudsley approach.

I avoid my family constantly, especially my mom. My parents have a long history of lying to therapists and making false promises. I have a lot of issues with my mom and i cannot handle her false promises anymore.

I know i’m 16 but i’m also like half moved out. I spend most nights at my girlfriend’s house and am set to get my diploma in a couple months. Staying with my girlfriend’s family is one of the things that’s prompted me to try recovery, anyway. Since they cook me food, help me cook, don’t pressure me/comment on what i eat.

I’ve agreed with my current therapist that working on my relationship with my parents is a waste of time right now, for lack of a better phrase, since my mother insists on not changing/communicating.

I have a lot of proof of these issues from CPS reports and past therapists, so i’m wondering if they will still *make* me eat with my family as part of treatment? 

I don’t think i have eaten a meal with my parents in months. If that’s actually a mandatory part of every program available to me i have no idea what i’m gonna do!!!!

My heart cannot take any more false promises from my mom in the safe cover of a therapy session. She’s said she would stop threatening me, stop misgendering me, stop invading my privacy all before and therapists always believe her. I know she is not going to change, at least for a while. I have put so much work into accepting that.

(Tw i mention drugs in this paragraph, spoiler tags not working on mobile)
I understand why family meals are a standard part of treatment for minors, i do. But my parents don’t even know i’m anorexic. I had a whole heroin addiction they didn’t notice. Why do i have to let them in???? 

I’m not trying to bitch and whine too much and i’m sorry if this came off as melodramatic. Asking for help on reddit is scary because people tend to make assumptions when it comes to families so i just want to ask that people don’t do that!"
Next step… chips,"So I been recovered for five years. Eating wise I eat ice cream, deserts, diet soda (only once a week cause when I first started drinking them again it gave me a oab) normally. I eat chips only if it’s on a taco salad and we have that once every 4 months and I’m ok with that. I haven’t bought a bag for myself long before I even had Ana because they weren’t allowed at my house cause it was messy. I ate a snack size bag a Cheetos with my salad at lunch today and I liked it. Afterwords I went grocery shopping and was going to buy the snack bag but couldn’t find them so I had to buy the regular size. I do have one Ana thought and that is will I get fat if I have the serving size with my salad sometimes but I don’t know why im worries cause I workout regularly and I wouldn’t go hard core because I had some chips but i need support from people other then my family cause they will think im crazy."
"Just a reminder a matter what you did today, what you already ate, how you feel, etc. You need to eat! Go make yourself a meal or snack, eat your full meal plan, and remember that you are so much more than your body! ❤️",Oh and a bigger meal than usual does NOT replace a snack. 🙃
I'm Overweight Now,"I've been recovering for 3.5 years. My weight gain hasn't stopped. I'm now at the point where I'm overweight (by BMI). I'm hesitant to diet, but where I'm at isn't healthy. Any suggestions or advice?"
Is this a disordered thought???,"In reality, how much food do you really need in self recovery? I am finding myself eating to 2k everyday but there is no weight gain.... and this makes me even question life... the fact that I was restricting so hard and barely loosing weight.. like why did I even do that when I could be eating 2k everyday. I realized that I could just live this life forever, aka eat 2k and maintain, but I am at a low bmi. I am not sure if this is a right thought. I AM eating, and eating ENOUGH, but I am at a low bmi. Am I... recovered? "
thinking about food vs hunger,"I tend to think about food throughout the day and I try to control it by holding it because I think it's just a craving. However, is this a sign of hunger? I realized that normal people don't actually think about food all day long.... "
The praise I got for being skinny is what sparked my ED,"I grew up very thin because of genetics and I was always praised for being so skinny. My relatives would make comments and even during clothes shopping random people would compliment how thin I was. I truly believe that this kind of treatment along with a friend who influenced these thoughts were what caused me to develop anorexia. I guess to ensure that I stayed thin I began to restrict before I even started noticing changes in my body as I got older (began when I was 16 ended at 18). I just wish that being thin wasn’t something that was praised. 

I needed to get that off my chest. Did anyone else have the same experience?"
Reflections from Recovery - Food is Fuel,"Hi everyone, been in recovery for about 6 months and I’m happy to say that I’ve made significant advancements in the last couple of weeks. My body and mind are healing and I feeling incredibly optimistic. However, this long-winded post isn’t meant to be congratulating myself. Instead, I figure I’d share a few thoughts and reflections from my own journey for anyone who may need to hear them. If possible, I’d like to space them out in future posts each covering a different topic. I’m not a medical expert, nor am I asking anyone to agree or follow what I share. Just a dude that’s been through it and trying to reach those who made need that extra push.

Food is not the enemy. We need it, it is fuel. It is the price of admission to all that is beautiful in life.

I was insecure. I desperately wanted to be skinny to be more appealing in my dating life. Well, I got what I wanted, but at what cost? We could never go to any of the places or do any of the things they wanted because I was always exhausted or because the food there wouldn’t accommodate my bogus diet. My ED took priority over my significant other. 

At the local fair, I starved myself all day in order to accommodate sharing a small funnel cake with them. I was tired, uncoordinated, nauseous and did not enjoy what should have been a cute experience. Worse yet, I felt the need to punish myself for indulging in sugar that day. So the following day I also heavily restricted myself to “atone”. How sad.. it’s not rocket science. All I had to do was share a treat with my parter and enjoy the moment, and I couldn’t even do that. Is that REALLY the way humans are meant to function? I kept circling back to this false belief that I was choosing to only eat “healthy” but was ANY of my behavior healthy? Of course not.

Guys, our bodies are amazing. Treasure them. Listen to them. They do all the thinking for us. If they need water they make us thirsty. If we’re low on something, they’ll make us crave certain things. Even better, our bodies are incredibly flexible and resilient. A single fairground treat was NOT gonna gonna hurt me. Our bodies are not as picky as we may believe they are. They take what they need in the moment and either store the rest for future use or discard it. 

I used to run. It was fun and good exercise. Well, I couldn’t even do that anymore. My body had no fuel. As an athlete, our bodies have additional nutritional needs, and I was depriving mine of that. My ED took my running legs away.

Guys, food is our fuel. It seems scary but you know what isn’t? Sharing a funnel cake with a loved one. Getting out and running in the breeze. But the only way to actually enjoy any of that is we’re meeting our body’s needs. Trust your body and enjoy all that is beautiful. Being thin means nothing if you’re missing out on everything wonderful this life has to offer.

It’s easier said than done but guys, its not only doable, but its totally worth it. 

My partner? We’ve compromised date nights where we either share a portion, or I join with a small kids meal. It’s silly but it’s a small step and something not possible in the before times. I’m spending quality time with the person I love, I’m mentally present and in high spirits. And you know what? Chipotle kids meals are delicious lol.

Running? As my body’s recovered, I’ve been able to start jogging again. Put on a podcast and let the sights and sounds wash over me. I’m not worried about how many calories I’m burning. In that moment I am just ALIVE.

And those are just TWO aspects of my life that I’m bouncing back from. There are countless more and I’m sure you the reader  will have your own as well. Fight for them. Life is amazing on the other side of the recovery process. I wish you all strength and determination. And I hope to hear your stories soon as well :)"
Seeing your weight,"I don’t have a scale, and I don’t particularly want start weighing myself or anything, but I know I need to be OK with seeing my weight at some point. I’m blind weighed at my doctors office but I know that’s not a fool proof method. Does anybody have tips for getting used to seeing your weight/seeing it and not caring?"
I want to recover,"I’m so sick and tired of anorexia. I’m sick of the control tower of my life and I just wanna fucking recover but I don’t know how. 
I’m terrified to gain weight 
I’m terrified to look different 
I’m terrified to lose a part of me 
A very sick part of me, but I’m terrified to  lose it 
I need help and I don’t know how to start"
"Thought I was finally recovered, now I just regret all of it",One picture was all it took for everything to come crashing down. One stupid picture my friend took of me where I look disgusting. I will spare everyone the details but just seeing it makes me regret everything I’ve done since I began to recover. I posted in this sub a while back that I was finally coming to terms with my post-recovery body and actually beginning to like it but now I’m back to square one where I absolutely loathe every part of my body. As a matter of fact I’ve just unlocked a new insecurity that never really bothered me before: the size of my legs. I just want to go back to how I looked before. I looked so much better.
I did it.,"I'm not recovered. But at least today I can claim a victory. It took a week and a half of enduring ""no"" after ""no"" from our friend Anna, but I at last overcome and got the Chinese food I've been wanting for so long.

Will link a picture but not post directly in case some folks here don't want to look at or be exposed to food pics.

Fear of having food in the house,My anorexia doesn’t stem from wanting to be skinny. It stemmed from my ability to control my “craving” when all this time it was literal hunger. Anyways ever since recovery I got into this weird psychotic feeling that I am afraid of certain foods in the house because I will eat it tomororw. I know it is so absurd but just wondering if anyone has this same problem……
What physical symptoms of anorexia did y’all have?,"I had insomnia, cold hands and feet/cold all the time, irritability, adrenaline rushes, cortisol was completely out of whack, fatigue, “wired but tired”, inflammation, slow digestion, arthritis in several joints, muscle aches, slow heart rate, low body temp, thinning hair, brittle nails and anxiety. And honestly this helped me figure out something was wrong.

What did y’all experience, if anything?

Edit - I updated my list a bit. Thanks for the replies! I feel like there’s a lot of people experiencing these symptoms from under eating and then they get convinced it’s “adrenal fatigue” and thusly ((gulp)) get on even more restrictive diets to try to “stop the inflammation and adrenals”. That’s what I got sucked into and it took me a year before God showed me I was just malnourished and had an eating disorder. Since beginning recovery everything has changed!"
should i keep facing fear foods?,"6 months into recovery. i've faced many fear foods and im proud of myself; peanut butter, granola, milk, ect. 

this is huge for me but i find that now that im basically weight restored, eating for maintenance rather than weight gain kind of makes the fear foods come back. i feel like i have to ""watch"" what i eat more intently because im afraid of gaining beyond my weight restored weight. 

i wanna maintain a healthy weight and eat healthy and part of that is ofc not overeating. but if i avoid smt for too long for the sake of being healthy, i start to become more afraid of it. 

for example, if i spend too long eating unsweetened oat milk i get afraid of having sweetened oat milk. is it normal for people who care about eating healthy to sometimes get anxious to have the ""unhealthier"" alternative? or is it just my ed? 

idk if i should continue facing fear foods if i feel like it'll just come back again."
having a tough time,"just needed to get this off my chest but basically, money is tight and I'm feeling bad about my body and I'm going through a lot in life not gonna get into it but just all around depressed and I'm the kind of person to just stop eating or drinking when I'm depressed and so having a hard time affording food and having a hard time making myself eat what I do have to eat... ugh... just really struggling today but I'm not gonna relapse I refuse to..."
Salt water taffy.,At the beach and had one piece of salt water taffy. I haven’t one since 2013-14 two years after that I got anorexic and then got stuck with braces. I don’t regret eating it but I don’t wanna have more cause back when I was a kid I would binge on them. My goal is having one a day while I’m here
Maintaining on a higher intake,Is it possible that you start maintaining weight at a higher intake than your sedentary tdee after recovery? And also should you be exercising while recovering?
I'm relapsing and panicking.,"My issues started at about 12 and I'll be 30 soon. Ive been fighting and winning for the last year and a half to two years ago, but lately? It's a struggle. I was on a medication that caused me to gain a substantial amount and since coming off of it and changing to a different medication I've lost about half of it. But it's also not in a healthy way for the most part. It started off just by trying to eat better, cut my portions and what not. I'm now watching myself spiral out of control and I don't know how to stop it. I'm drinking more water again so I don't feel as hungry and have barely been eating. I know it's not healthy, I know it's wrong but I don't know how else to lose this fast."
Concerning blood work,"Did anyone else get concerning blood work results in recovery?? My liver enzymes are very high for some reason and it’s freaking me out. I’ve been recovering for over a year, and while I was in the depths of anorexia at my absolute worst, my blood work was perfect. Now that I’m eating a lot more and trying to take better care of myself, my blood work is showing all these issues. I even have signs of vitamin deficiencies that I didn’t have at all when I literally wasn’t eating anything. I even take vitamin supplements now so it’s confusing. I don’t get how I’m seemingly doing worse even though I’m trying to get better??? It’s making me scared to eat because now I feel like I’m eating the wrong things. I also overshot the weight gain by a lot which was fine with me until I saw the test results which makes me feel like all the people criticizing my weight gain are right. I’m so scared I’m being unhealthy by allowing myself to eat what I want without restriction, but I don’t know how else to recovery. I haven’t had a chance to talk to my doctor about the results yet, but I’m just so confused. Has this happened to anyone else?"
how do i know if i’m relapsing?,"i’ve been doing really great in recovery, i’ve been weight restored, got my period back after losing it for 7 months, and i’m eating normally and i was beginning to have a great relationship with my body. i was doing dietician and doctor approved weight training regularly and it drastically improved my mental health.
for the past week and a half, my family has been in the process of moving. i haven’t been able to go to the gym or do yoga or eat my safe healthy foods. suddenly i feel like my mindset is back to where it was months ago. i’m obsessing over how horrible i’m eating and how lazy i am and how fat i’ve gotten from eating more sugar than usual. i’ve been getting loads of urges to start restricting or purging in secret but i’ve yet to act on them yet. my brain is basically 90% anorexia thoughts again and i’m so pissed because i thought i was doing better but now i feel like i’ve relapsed. also, i don’t have my therapist or dietician anymore since we’ve moved so i’m really worried for the next few months without therap"
"I told my therapist and my mom about my ED, not sure how to feel now","Yesterday I ended up telling my therapist about my eating disorder, it was right at the end of the session so we didn’t really have time to talk about it, but now she knows. Then after spending like half an hour driving around trying to decide whether I would tell my mom, I decided to not tell her. And, once I got home, I ended up telling her…. So… yea…. I feel a lot less stress cause now I feel like I don’t have to hide it quite as much, but at the same time, I don’t really feel any better. Now my therapist knows and my mom knows too, so I will prob have to recover. Which I know is supposed to be a good thing, but I honestly don’t see how I can. I don’t know how I am supposed to not be like this forever. I keep trying to tell myself that this is a good thing, telling them about it, but I can’t stop feeling like I just made a huge mistake telling them. I don’t even know what to feel right now"
Running in Recovery,"Hello! I have been in nutrition recovery for the past two months or so, and I was finally granted permission to run again (my favorite hobby since I have been a child). I haven't run in the past two months, but ran everyday for 8 years before I had to take time off. Even though I am right now only running a few times per week for half an hour, my body is incredibly sore (my back and knees feel pain). Is this due to the weight gain? Or just from not running in a while?"
How it all started,"In your case, do you remember how your Eating Disorder started?"
Memory Problems?,"I have a horrible memory, which could be a result of many things, like former/prolonged psych meds, PTSD, and/or cannabis use, but my number one suspect is that I damaged my brain from starving it. For those who have more or less recovered after being underweight or after severe/prolonged restriction, do any of you have a good memory? Or one that isn't obviously bad compared to how it used to be?  

&#x200B;"
I wasn't even gonna post but,"I went to my grandparents dual memorial service last weekend and my 90 year old great aunt and I got to talking and she said ""the last time I saw you you were..."" and I finished her sentence ""younger?""

She said ""no you were much thinner.""

I thought about it and the last time I saw her was around 2 weeks before my second partial inpatient stay. I'm probably like a size 4 or 6 dress size now. 

Now there is a chance she was referencing that thinness as I am doing better now but I fully doubt it. This side of the family really ignited my ED as a kid. So here I am, 7 years later, obsessing over this old woman's words. This thing is fuckin wild. I'll be okay, but I've just gotta let this go."
Maintaining on high cals after recovery,No clue if this is true but I heard recovered anorexics tend to just maintain on more calls even after recovery? If this is true honestly this will motivate me to continue to recover. Recently have been eating an insane amount of food but lowkey hope I could continue doing this deep down
Self Conscious After Recovering,"I (20F) made an effort over the last few months or so to gain some weight and while my body feels healthier, I feel so insecure about my appearance. I feel like none of my clothes fit me the way I want them to and it’s extremely uncomfortable and upsetting. I like how I feel but I hate how I look. I feel like everyone is judging me too. I was wondering if you guys had any tips for getting over this extreme insecurity. It feels like all I can think about."
Has anyone gone from anorexia to binge eating disorder and is now considered overweight?,
I got my period!!!,"
For the first time in four years I got my period! 

I’ve been putting on weight for a year and a half now, trying to do it as slow as I could while telling my mom that I “didn’t mean to lose it” and about a month ago I opened up to her and started real recovery and now I got my period!

Recovery may be one of the most difficult things there is, but geez it’s amazing! I still have a long way to go, but this is a sign that I’ve been doing the right thing! <3"
Osfed/Ednos help.,"Recovery comes and goes but I have yet to find a support forum that fits better than here.

I know the acronyms have changed since I was young but it's a mix, mostly on food restriction.

I am trying again to recover and wondering if others also are experiencing nausea/vomiting and diarrhea from small meals.  It's literally been xx days and I began to eat once in the nights again.  It could be the heat in my area but I feel I have it everytime I eat and it deters me.

If you also have this please tell me your remedy, the cramps and lethargy is so sucky."
Debilitating body image,"I’m 2 months into recovery and my BMI went from underweight to overweight in just a couple of months!! I cannot stand to look in the mirror, have my picture taken, or even be around friends/family or in public. I’m just so ashamed of how big I am. I haven’t dressed up since I started recovering, even putting on makeup makes me want to die. I just hate everything about how I look. I cry every single night. I am genuinely so uncomfortable in my own skin it’s unbearable. I want to give up because I was literally a million times happier in my ED. I’m so confused because everyone talks about glowing and being so happy in recovery but I’m in the darkest place I’ve ever been in. Sorry I’m ranting but please please does anyone have advice or an experience similar to mine or are on the other side of recovery? Anything would be such appreciated."
"End of school meal and I found out I’m the only one eating and now I feel alone 16F (Warning mention of , BMI, weight gain/loss,body comparing,diet,vaping,etc)","I’m so annoyed. I went to a special needs school so because it’s so small we can’t have a prom so instead the teachers arranged us to go to a fancy restaurant. It’s a set menu so we pick out of certain options and pay in advance. So I did that thinking everyone else would be doing the same. But come to find out that no one else has ordered food. NO ONE. Like I knew one person wasn’t because she doesn’t like eating in public but I didn’t expect everyone to do it. It seems like everyone else was competing with her. 

This is honestly my last straw. I used to have anorexia and was underweight. But I made a recovery but as I was doing that I started anti depressants which made me gain twice as much weight. Which made me even more insecure.Recently I’ve been eating less again as when I went to the doctors a few months ago they weighed me (that’s the only time I get weight because my parents got rid of the scales) I was only just in healthy weight almost overweight according to BMI. 

I’ve never been overweight before. Or almost overweight. Even before the original ED. I have always been the “skinny friend”. And now I’m the “fat friend”. My friends who have got ED’s and are really underweight I am kind of jealous of them. I don’t think they know how insecure I really am. I have this one friend who always comments on mine and her body. I don’t think she means it in a mean way and I think it comes out of a place of being insecure because she’s so skinny.

No one except my parents seem to realise how badly I’m struggling. The worst it got was I went to town with a friend and was vaping all day which made my hunger go down and went home saying I’d eaten. Which I could prove as I went into Burger King and took a picture of the Burger King crowns.

After this meal I’m going to do that every day that I can. I never want to eat again other than to survive. I feel humiliated and like they all planned this to get to me. They are all so competitive with ED’s and I’m not just saying that. They always talk about how much/little they and others are eating and how their BMI is severely underweight. 

I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I only ordered in the first place because I assumed everyone else would.

I’m not going to eat anything all day other than the meal. And after the meal I’m going to try to eat as little as possible until Saturday as I am acting,singing and dancing in a show that day so don’t want to pass out."
The plate method?,"My dietitian recently suggested I try the plate method, focusing on building balanced meals with a source of protein, carbs, fat, and a veggie or fruit in each one. I tried it today and it was actually really satisfying. It’s also a good way to make me try new things instead of calorie counting. Has anybody else tried this method and if so, what did/do you think about it?"
Greasy hair,"I'm about 2-3 months into recovery and weight restored, but my hair has become super greasy as of lately. It looked SO OILY today when I'm washing it every other fay. Dry shampoo didn't even help. At the same time, it is also still falling out and I lose a ton of hair every time I wash and dry it. Is this because of changes in my diet, or changes in my hormones since I just got my period back recently after not having it for months? Has anyone experienced this? What do I do?"
I don't think I'll ever recover,"TW: mentions of routine weight check

I've tried over and over again but I always end back where I started or even worst

but it's all thrown out the window now cause I'm worst then I was before 

I play a sport where your weight is important to know and I've just been obsessing over it now I've been told by coaches I need to gain weight, that I'm tall I shouldn't weight this much, that I'm loosing weight way beyond what I need to and I need to stop but i don't think I can

I feel sick cause of how much I lost, I get dizzy, sometimes I blackout for small periods of time, my vision get blurry

Recovering Anorexic,"I know this is bold and very out there; I’m a recovering anorexic, I’ve been in recovery for about 2-3 years and continuing to progress day by day. Now that I’m at the point where I need to be mentally which is, eating when I need to. I feel as if I suddenly don’t have enough in order to eat the amount I need. I’ve always had a fast metabolism as well so that always kept me hungry all day but I just have questions for others on how to consistently eat throughout the day without spending so much money, or feeling like I need to space out my meals more to save money?

Mental calorie counting,"I’m having trouble stopping calorie counting. I deleted the apps and all, I just keep tallying in my head. I convince myself that it’s so I don’t under eat but I think it’s so I don’t under OR over eat. So I eat the “right amount”. I live alone in a college dorm so I can’t really cook much and don’t have anybody to make me food. Any tips to stop?"
"Howdy Ho, very specific tip in case you get your wisdom teeth out while recovering!","I needed to get my wisdom teeth out for several years, but unfortunately my undiagnosed AN symptoms prevented me from being well enough to go under and remove them. Today it happened, and my dietitian was super supportive abt my meal plan and said “yk it’s a medically necessary, temporary diet, I’m not too worried abt it” which was relieving to me. I had boosts, smoothies, a milk shake, and Gatorade, but I was so flipping hungry and I needed some type of carb, so I had the semi-genius idea to get some rice pudding and liquify it in the blender and voila! Severe hunger abided 😄sometimes you learn unusual skills and I am proud of myself for my idea (although someone has probably had it before 😅)"
Craving only snacks,"I’m 15 months in recovery and still only cravings sweets, snacks, processed foods, etc. I know these foods aren’t bad because no food is “bad,” but I thought I would be craving more variety by now? I do occasionally crave things like fruit, chicken, sandwiches, pasta, but the large majority of the time I just want sweets and processed food. It makes me worry that something’s wrong bc I thought cravings like this were only common in the beginning of recovery? Is anyone else experiencing something like this?"
How do I reset my metabolism now,I’m gaining more weight now and i DONT know what I can do to reset my metabolism I think my body got adjusted to um like put on more weight when you eat less anyways i think I seriously killed my metabolism
Feeling like I don’t “need” to recover,"About a year ago I reached my lowest weight an my mom realized something was up. I told her I lost the weight by accident because I’m so busy in college that I forget to eat and she bought it. I knew I had to gain in order for her to stop though, and I was worried I would die, so I agreed to do so but told myself once I reached a minimum healthy BMI I would go to maintaining and would not gain any more.

I finally reached that number but realized a few weeks ago that I don’t want to live like that anymore. I opened up to her and my therapist and got the AN diagnosis and decided to take on true recovery. 

The problem is that everything in me is telling me I don’t need recovery. I keep telling myself I don’t need extra snacks and I should be working out and eating maintenance calories only because I’m physically ok but I’ve only just started working on my mentality so I know I’m not recovered. I know AN is a mental disorder, I’m just really struggling to accept that. Part of me feels like I’m faking it since I’m weight restored and I was more or less ok with gaining a little weight initially. Any advice?"
Can you die from being anorexic if you recover?,I am trying to recover from anorexia but I heard you can have a shorter lifespan even if you recover fully
Do we need protein snacks !,"Hello,

Because of our problem, our daily needs are not usual
We must eat more, in quantity i mean
Then we can have several snacks
But whenever I read, watch or listen things about snacks, it's always a balanced meal and people use a lot of proteins powder.
Then, I would like to know if is ok to replace protein powder by refined carbs and yogurt+ protein by ice cream cone :)"
"How do I block the search term ""calories"" on my phone without having the option to revert the decision","As the title says I want to keep myself from looking up calories as much as possible, but I always end up getting desperate and deleting the app. Letting a friend put parental controls on my phone would probably be a good idea but I don't have anyone that I'm that close with.
Is this even possible to do? And if so please tell me how"
Anyone else just prefer eating stuff that's marketed towards children?,"Like chocolate crossiant that's marketed towards everyone and is probably healthier? -No way
Chocolate crossiant with a bright colored silly monster on the packaging?
-OH MY GOD YES"
"I originally made this for a binge eating sub, but it fits more here :(","Along with binge eating disorder, I suffer from anorexia. I haven't been anorexic in YEARS. I've mainly just been suffering with binge eating. A few days ago an event happened that put me in a lot of distress & caused me to lose my appetite for a few days. I lost a lot of weight because I was barely eating. After the dust settled after this event I will admit I let my anorexia extend me not eating for a day or two more(i'm actually still KINDA letting it reign over me).

I was craving some chips & candy at work today. I'm vegan so I have a very limited variety to choose from. I was planning on getting a big bag of twizzlers & some lays chips(i hate lays, but they're vegan & I wanted something salty/spicy, so 🤷‍♂️)

I ended up only getting grapes! And i got the smallest bag of grapes they had & I stopped eating them once my appetite for them was gone!

I want to make it clear grapes were not the only thing i ate all day. I actually was giving myself a pass to binge because I ate a lot more than what I've been typically eating lately.

It's hard to explain, but being vegan is still new to me, I'm trying to learn how my body reacts & is changing to a vegan diet. Im not expecting anything TOO drastic because I've already been Pescatarian for like 2 years before this & for a couple weeks before going full vegan I cut all dairy out of my diet. Like I heard some vegans talk about how they can eat a bowl of oatmeal & be good for a whole day.

But basically I know this sounds anorexic af, but I just had like some vegetables for lunch. I didn't know if it would keep me full for the rest of the day or not. i ended up getting hungry like an hour later, so I brought these plant based pretzels filled with peanut butter. I've brought them before & they are very filling. 

These peanut butter pretzels & the vegetables I ate earlier, made me believe I messed up today & I should binge. That brings us back to the start of this post(sorry a little disorganized, I should have started with this).

Please don't be to harsh or judgemental about my anorexia. I feel worse about being anorexic than I do binge eating, because the feeling of denying your body nutrients it needs is horrible. And as skinny as I have gotten, i like how I look BUT i worry it may be a cry for help from my body that it needs more food. I don't think i'm too skinny rn, but then again idk because I have body dismorphic disorder.

*** everything above was written in the binge eating sub. I just didn't think they would understand my struggles with anorexia & i was worried they'd be a little harsh. It's just late at night right now, and I'm alone & I don't want to be bombarded with comments about how bad being anorexic is for your body, I know it is. But i would just like some kind supportive words right now. I'm sad that at what I've done to my body over the past few days."
how to maintain recovery,"i'm not sure if this is the right place, i'm new to posting on reddit but could use some support. i've been in 'recovery' (unofficially i guess, ive had no support from doctors or therapists) for 2+ years and i've been doing well! i got my weight back up and i have a much healthier relationship with food overall, with a lot of bumps along the road, but recently i've moved back home after university and noticed i'm teetering on unhealthy weight gain. i want to be healthy, so i'm making changes to my lifestyle (working out and eating healthier) but it all feels so weird. i went from not eating enough to eating too much and i feel like i've just returned to not being in control. i'm scared i'm gonna go back to my old ways and undo all the work i've done. it doesn't help that i'm living with my mother who was the root cause of my eating issues, i feel like i'm that 13 year old girl again. i guess i was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to maintain their path of recovery in these kinds of circumstances, for the first time ever i want to lose a bit of weight just to be healthy not for any other reason - but im scared when i do lose that weight that it wont be enough and i'll spiral. any advice would be greatly appreciated and i apologise again if this isnt the right place for this!"
nausea and gagging when trying to eat,hihi!! ive been in recovery for a few years and when im super stressed or overwhelmed i struggle to get any food down at all. i am currently nibbling a bagel like a mouse to avoid fainting. do u guys have any tips?? i think i need to get some protein shakes
lost focus... thinking of food all day,I genuinely do not know what to do anymore. I cannot function because when I'm outside I am thinking about food and yesterday I had a flight home and I almost missed my flight because my focus is on food. Is this just my body being hungry? I am so confused and really just want help..... I don't know what to do anymore. I know I am thinking about food yet I can't get myself to actually eat what I am thinking about. I have eaten enough though. I literally do not know what is wrong with me.... 
What was first time inpatient like?,"How long was the stay, Getting used to mealplans, Refeeding symptoms, tips for faster recovery, when/ the switch to outpatient, did the weight and bloat go away and how soon, getting through meals, etc"
Happiness??,I have been in recovery for just over a year now and i still am picking up the pieces from my ed and trying to put my old self back together. Idk its just that nothing feels the same. All the stuff that used to make me feel happy just doesn’t do it for me anymore. Like the stuff that used to make me feel alive not even day to day stuff although dont get me started on that. It feels like the only thing i get joy out of is watching the number drop on the scale and i havent even seen that in a year. I just dont know how to find something quite as satisfying as anorexia. And at the same time im weight restored so i dont even feel anorexic anymore. Has anyone else felt like this and overcome it? Are some people just not built for recovery?
"First time inpatient, pls help!","Just got admitted inpatient yesterday and am now finished my second day…

My stomach is so bloated and uncomfortable, no bowel movements for almost 6 days, and physically don’t think I’ll be able to keep anymore food down tomorrow. 

I’m debating just taking ensure/supplement drinks tomorrow, (but its an Ed stress for me because of the liquid kcls/processed macros and if it ends up being more dense in the end than if I were to just eat the food)  

1) I guess my first question is: are the supplements easier on the stomach but still nutritionally the EXACT same? 

2)which out of the six eating times would be best to replace (breakfast,AMsnack,Lunch,Pmsnsck,Dinner,NTsnack)

3)Is the weight I gain within the first week going to be mostly bloat or actual fat? (If/and will it even be noticeable in a week) 

4)what’s the minimum/average stay for inpatient treatment (teen). Do they mostly base discharge on Medical status or bmi/regain? 

Overall ANY tips/heads-ups/or first week experience or notices would be REALLY appreciated please!! 

(also if you have any knowledge on ensures that could help to compare)"
weight restored but struggle w body dysmorphia,"its not a daily issue but i def feel uncomfortable remembering my weight/bmi and sometimes get insecure in the mirror. on some occasions it affects me so much i cant even look at myself w/o crying. i know im not fat, but thats all i feel like sometimes.  how can i overcome body dysmorphia so that i can fully recover?"
Inpatient weight gain experiences,
Anorexia hairloss,"hey, i've had anorexia mitxed with bulimia for many years. I've had episodes where i was at a normal weightrange, but most of the time, i've been underweight. not severe but still underweight. All this time I never had too big of an issue with my hair. i just noticed that if i look at pictures of my past my hair looked way better when i was at a normal weight. since a few years i stopped having any anorexic thoughts and i'm really trying to gain weight but due to stress and other reasons it just never worked out. at the same time my hairloss started. The chances are pretty high that the hairloss is due to other reasons than malnutrition, but i'm still hopefull that gaining weight will help me. So here my question: I've read of many people talking about their hairloss during anorexia; Sorry if i am asking so specific but how can i imagine the hairloss process? Especially for those of you who had anorexia or where underweight for a long time like me... was your hair like falling out constantly for all this years? How did you not get bald? yeah, sorry if my post is a bit confusing, english is not my first language, Thank you so much in advance"
The other thing in this relationship.,"you know? It's fucked up.

I have started to reflect on many things, such as, for example, most of my problems with my fiancé are due to anorexia, he wants to see me recovered and I want to see myself skeletal cuz that for me might be calm down that bitch (you know she Is never satisfied) And that's how the pendulum is, I want to recover then no, then we fight and then we give up, always due to the same issue.

We're perfect all day, but then there comes a point at night where my head says ""time to fuck your fiancé by telling him to fuck off you're not going to recover wahoo!"" And so we are... We don't fight like other couples; cuz to text messages or misunderstandings, deceit or lies, why ""he"" spoke to ""her"" or shit like that, no no. Is different, He and I fight because I hate healing and because he wants me to love me as much as he loves me, because I hate my body and he loves every fucking cell in me, cause he hates my Anorexia and I have it clinging to me as if it were my skin...

It is fucked up realizing that either you recover or you lose the love of your life, because he loves you so much that he does not want to see you dead or dying in front of him...
It is horrible to realize that, in reality, anorexia will be the end of both of us, it will be the death of the ""us"".

I realized that either I end my toxic relationship with food and myself or I end up with my fiancé...And I don't want to lose him...

you know? He has problems with his body, he does not accept himself and has many physical insecurities, I try to make him happy and love himself as much as I love him but I think it is impossible for me to help him if I am a bitch with myself,I want him to love himself as much as I love him, but first I have to show him that I love myself so much that I can give that love to him too...

I don't want to lose him and I'm scared that my future is just me swallowing a fucking apple a day and him surely sad hating the world... I don't want that, I want him to love himself and be as happy as i am With him...

I don't want to lose him, I'd rather go through recovery hell a thousand times than be without him in the future, because he's an angel and he shouldn't feel bad about himself... But first i need to heal myself...

I don't want that other thing to take over us and leave us sad and alone, I don't want to lose Him.

But I'm so scared that I'm terrified of what my recovery will be like... 

I hope one day he forgives me, for the hell I put him through...

Just today! Today we were able to have breakfast together! Damn it was amazing... I love him so much... I don't want to lose him

My life without anorexia will be shit I know, but without him... Shit I don't want to live."
Inpatient hurdle (potential trigger warning),"As the title says, I'm 4 weerks into an inpatient ED recovery program. I'm no longer medically unstable, but keep getting treated like I am? I'm having to consume literally thousands of extra calories while being basically on bed rest, despite vital signs being stable and no symptoms of malnutrition. Is this normal? I feel like I'm in Crazy Town, this all goes against all the logic my ED is able to muster."
not wanting to recover??,"well of course the title isn’t probably fit for this subreddit, (seeming at it is the recovery subreddit) but i need some advice from people who have gone through or are going through the same thing currently. okay so as you read from the title, i don’t really want to recover. well, i do but i don’t. i don’t know what i want. if i do recover, i feel bad because i feel like i haven’t been “sick enough” and i feel uncomfortable coming out of the habits ive been surrounded with for awhile. i feel like a haven’t had an ED long enough for recovery. (i don’t know if that makes sense) i mean like i haven’t had it for a like really long period of time (it will be 2 years around thanksgiving) and i feel like i haven’t lost enough weight to even think about starting recovery. i do also on the contrary want to get better. i want to have thicker hair, whiter teeth, more personality, less mood swings, and less obsessiveness over food. im just EXTREMELY afraid to gain weight in recovery, because i haven’t lost enough to gain back. if anyone has struggled with this and is willing to give me some advise or haven’t gone through this but has some advise for trying to start going through recovery, please give me suggestions. thanks for reading"
Short update with slight trigger warning?,"A few says ago I posted me not being able to eat much because of stress.

I now hardly am able to eat, even tho I'm now actually feeling hunger. All due to teeth problems. One is cracked since yesterday and hurts a lot, on the complete opposite I got a hole.
They will get fixed soon, hopefully.

All I eat now is.. baby food. Nothing solid anymore until it's fixed. 
 Need to take supplements to actually get nutrients in my body, so nothing gets worse.

I feel like fainting constantly, my head hurts, my heartbeat isn't the way it should be, my stomach constantly growls and much more.

I don't know what to do until my teeth get fixed. 
But I know one thing - ana is around the corner, somewhere distant. 

I'm honestly afraid about it all. 
For the first time in my life, I'm scared of not being able to eat right.

Any advice or anything from you beautiful people? I'm at my wits end."
Better body image than general population after your ED?,"I’ve heard many therapists say that people who have recovered from an ED have better and stronger body confidence than most people because of how much they worked on it. That always surprised me, because I’ve also heard other people say the ED voice never leaves you- you just learn to ignore it. If you’re fully recovered, what’s your experience with this?"
Friend makes rude comments when I try to explain that I’m proud of my progress,"Possible TW for the whole competition thing that comes with EDs 

I had diagnosed EDNOS (which became anorexia) for 2-3 years and I finally began recovery last year. I am very proud of myself for doing so. I have noticed obvious changes in my body and it has taken a long time to come to terms with these things, but I have finally begun to. 

My friend in question had anorexia as well and is recovered. We both still have self-esteem issues. I mentioned to her that I was finally starting to like my appearance and realized that I look healthier, brighter and even better. (Though I never thought I’d say this) I mentioned to her that I was proud of myself, and starting to like my post-recovery body and expected to be met with her saying that was great and she was happy for me. Instead, I’m met with the words “yeah well if you looked like me, you’d kill yourself.” 

She kept going on about that and turned the conversation into how she hates herself and thinks I’d kill myself if I had her body. It hurt me because she can’t even be happy for me with my recovery. And I get it. I have low self esteem too. But even if I thought those things, I wouldn’t say it to my friend who is expressing that they’re proud of their progress. I’d at least fake being happy for them. It honestly feels like she constantly wants to drag me down with her. 

Not to mention that she kinda made things worse for me when I was sick. She’d mention her weight, what she ate, her measurements, etc. to me and then call herself fat and stuff in front of me while she was skinnier than me so it made me think that she must think I’m huge and stuff. I don’t wanna blame her because I was an awful person deep in my ED but hearing it all the time made my ED a lot worse."
my boyfriend just asked me to give up coffee,"first for context, he is the only person i have talked about my ED with besides mental health professionals. and while we spend a lot of time not really knowing how to talk about it i have opened up recently and we have begun to have some conversations. this started after a particularly bad day of relapse and he asked me to start consuming more liquid calories as it might be easier to incorporate and supplement my diet and i have started doing that. same with taking a multivitamin. he has now—as of this morning—asked me to give up coffee because of the issues i have with my stomach lining. on my end, i understand the health effects but i feel i am being asked to give up the one thing in my day that i actually enjoy consuming. he compared it to him coming off of nicotine which i think is not a fair comparison at all. and he said that yes, chemically it is different but the negative effects on our bodies is comparable. 

not looking for relationship advice here but just reaching out to people who might have the same problems—have any of your health professionals told you you can’t have coffee? have any of you cut out coffee and seen any improvements?"
How do I reach out to my therapist about a possible eating disorder?,"Hi, I (14F) just started therapy and I would like to talk to her about a possible eating disorder.

I have a bad relationship with food for a while now and I'm finally thinking about recovering from it but I don't know how do I start a conversation about that with my therapist.

could somebody help my?"
following recovery meal plan,"About 5 days ago, i was assigned a meal plan by a dietitian to help me recover, give my body the energy it needs, restore weight, ect. This meal plan consists strictly of 3 meals and one snack before bed or later at night. the 3 meals must have something from every food group. Ex: fruit, protein, dairy, grain, and veg. I’ve been trying my best to follow this plan because i’m only at the VERY BEGINNING of recovery and i know it would help but i feel very controlled… some mornings i wake up and don’t want “2 servings of fruit” with my toast, or sometimes at lunch i don’t want a dairy source with my sandwich. another thing i’ve been noticing is i personally have always preferred 2-3 lighter meals with plenty of snacks opposed to 3 big meals with one little snack or no snacks at all. (which is what my plan is insisting) Moral of the story, i absolutely HATE following the plan. It’s stressing me out completely and it doesn’t even feel like i’m recovering because i’m not eating what my body wants to eat.. sure i’m eating “enough” or “what my body needs” but it’s not enjoyable for me whatsoever. Any tips to get past this? If i don’t follow the plan completely but i eat enough calories should i be ok in my recovery? Anything helps, thanks!"
Shaking?,Is anyone else’s body shaking after light exercise? I went for a 10 min walk and my body began to shake pretty vigorously. :/ anyone experienced this in early rec?
I am so scared of dying,"I just started recovery, but there’s a two month waitlist. I am so scared I’m gonna die. I try to eat everyday and I do, but I feel so full and get nauseous so quick. I’m so scared it’s not enough and I’m gonna die. I call a psychiatric hotline almost everyday because I have panic attacks over it, and they keep telling me I’m fine but my body hurts so much and I feel so sick. They say I can’t die if I eat everyday even if it’s only a little bit, but I feel like they’re just saying that to calm me down. I saw some girl on TikTok saying that it doesn’t even matter what you weigh or how long you’ve been sick, as long as you’re “starving” you can die and it just freaked me out so bad. I wish I was just normal and everything was fine, I want to recover so bad, but I physically can’t. 

I’m sorry if I said anything that’s not allowed I just don’t know where to go"
Trouble eating due to stress,"As the title says I have trouble eating for a few days now. 

I'm going through really stressful events atm and I get hunger cues, but they only last for a few minutes. If I try to eat, I feel very ill and super full immediately.

I'm not sure as to what to do. 
I can't force myself to eat anymore, since my body is going against it. 
I also can't not eat anything, so I try baby food. It's still the same. 
And also the same happens when I try to drink anything.
It all tastes off. 

I feel weak, yet also active. 

Does anyone have any kind of advice for me?

I'm scared to fall back into liking it or feeling comfortable while this is going on. 

Right now it makes me super uncomfortable and I just want it to change."
Teenage Recovery from Anorexia,"Hey all! This is my first post here. I (17 M) have struggled with anorexia and malnutrition for quite a bit of my teenage years (somewhere between 13-17 years old). I have thankfully luckily recovered and have a safe BMI. 

I am wondering if anyone knows if the body development I’ve lost by not properly feeding myself can be made up as I live the rest of my life. I only ask this question because I feel that I’m not properly developed. (I have a younger looking face, no beard, and my voice has not changed) 

Please let me know if this post may not belong in this community. Thank you so much."
Years after recovery - health anxiety,I had an eating disorder from age 14-27. Most severe from 14-21 and then a lot of work on recovery with relapses. I recovered largely on my own and am now 32 and find myself having severe health anxiety with every pain. I struggle to know what pains are real and I should be concerned about. My pcp (in a new city so a new doctor to me) knows I had an eating disorder but that’s it - does not know how severe it was. I feel like every complaint he goes straight to anxiety. But that maybe if he knew how malnourished I was he would take my complaints seriously. But ten minutes for an entire visit doesn’t seem to give enough time. Does anyone else find themselves having severe health anxiety years after recovery and feeling like every pain is damage from ED? Have any of you found real problems years later that you feel were caused by ED?
It's Okay To Like Plain Oatmeal,"Just a PSA: It may be a stereotypical ""ED safe food"", but it's okay to enjoy plain oatmeal, vegetables, fruit...it doesn't mean it's your ""ED voice talking"". It's okay to not like dairy products or have food preferences in general. It doesn't necessarily mean you're still ""actively"" restricting."
anyone looking for a recovery buddy?,"i am seeing a doctor who specializes in eds every week and my second visit is in 2 days n i’m a bit worried about the recovery process.  i was thinking it would be less overwhelming if i had a friend (in recovery or recovered) that i could talk to about recovery n stuff besides that!!! i’m a 15 year old girl who likes movies (breaking bad and black swan 🔛🔝), painting, pinterest @livsofie9, makeup, and books 💗💗"
Heartstopper triggered me to recover,"First I have to give you a bit of context; I am a gay guy in an extremely beautiful and healthy relationship, we are engaged and in general we are going well, except for one thing... Yes, you know what I'm taking about.

Most of the discussions (if not all, really), are around my eating disorder, he loves me so much and he wants me well and he actually loves to see me recovering, but me? Well I just want my old behaviors back in my life, yes, you know the classic ""I want to recover-I don't want to recover"" pendulum.

Yesterday a friend of mine sent me the heartstopper book, and as some of you may know, Charlie, one of the main characters has an eating disorder. I inadvertently identified so much with myself and the fact that my fiancé and I look a lot like Nick and Charlie (Physically and emotionally)... Well that hurt me a lot, I realized many things and mainly that I don't want him to deal with me as his fiancé with an ED, but as HIS real fiancé, as someone who really exist and it's not just an empty shell.

The first thing I did after reading those books was to write to him that I was really sorry for the shit that I had put him through, all the fights he had trying to make me see reason and me being a fucking bitch stuck on getting into a fucking bmi number, all those arguments and tears, those times we really got mad and everything really...

I am honest? I am afraid, very afraid, because although thanks to that comic I realized that in reality there are many beautiful and wonderful things to fight for with my babe, I am afraid of my head and the horrible things that It have to say to myself...

Although the comic triggered me to recover, I don't know, I feel very hypocritical when I talk about recovering, it's like ""oh sure, you tell me now but tomorrow you'll surely stop eating"" or something like that, I don't know, I feel that this is what my loved ones think, I know that my fiancé does not think like that so, because he has told me on several occasions ""I'm going to fuck you enough so that you have the strength to get up with me, I will not let you fall, and every time you relapse I will fuck you again because you are not alone"" (yes in a positive way) But I feel that I may tire him...

I feel hypocritical to tell him for a moment ""I want to recover 100% damn let's order pizzas!"" And the other ""fuck u I want to lose weight, and you're not going to stop me"" I feel crazy, I feel out of myself, I feel delirious, I feel completely irrational...

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with you. I don't want opinions I just wanted to get it off my chest. The truth is that all of this is difficult and sometimes I have moments of lucidity where my ill brain shuts down and then my healthy brain comes into operation, sometimes I am aware and other times I am just blinded by chasing a number on the scale... I just want a normal life with my partner, to be happy and have dinner with him in a random and not pre investigated for me restaurant.

I wish to be normal, like anyone else... :( 

Why did I have to suffer from anorexia? Why?"
What compliments you like hearing?,"Hello everyone, my English is not the best but I will try to do my best. My girlfriend has been suffering anorexia for more or less two years. She is finishing her treatment, but as you may know progress is not lineal, so she has been having relapses every-now and then but she is progressing. She tells me that she likes when I make comments like: “how beautiful you are today” or “you are beautiful” and I like saying them, since I really mean them and for me she is the most beautiful girl in the world. That’s why I’m asking what others compliments can I say to her without hurting her feelings."
Finally becoming happy with my post-recovery body,"I won’t go into details for the sake of others, but I am finally coming to terms with my body and becoming happy with how it looks after recovering. I started recovering in 2021 and had low self-esteem since my ED started but I feel like it’s finally looking up."

Hate feeling full,It’s not even being ‘full’ it’s the feeling/knowing of food in my stomach. It’s the main reason I abused lax because I just had to have an empty flat stomach… how did people navigate around this in recovery? did anyone feel the same… 💗
Grazing,"I need some help. My life is spent almost entirely at home as I don’t have a job and can’t drive (im a teen). I feel like I am constantly eating. I’m always going into the kitchen and grabbing a handful of whatever. It’s always something small but I cannot stop the habit unless I’m out or with another person all day. I finish a meal and then like 15 minutes later go into the kitchen to grab something else. Whenever I do it, im not hungry. It’s just a habit that I can’t seem to break. Is there an underlying reason for this? Or any other advice would be much appreciated!"
Quasi recovery,"I am stuck right now in my recovery. I really want to get better and be able to be a normal eater. I’m a teenager and want to be able to eat like one. Like being able to eat more some days, less others. Not having to eat exactly 3 meals 3 snacks. Being able to be unhealthy and just have fun. I just don’t know where to go from here. I don’t know if I am weight restored but I have stayed at the same weight for about 2 months. I don’t eat a ton but I eat enough and don’t calorie count anymore. I regularly challenge foods but everything still feels so calculated. Not free. I get so tired from decision making. I never feel satisfied because I’m always overthinking if I ate enough or too much. If anyone has any tips for getting to the next stage/becoming a completely normal eater I would highly appreciate it."
Has anxiety medication helped for anyone?,"Ill try not to detail my habits, but I may slip up. Everything is so normalized to me, so just let me know. 

Ive physically recovered from anorexia for about 4 years now, but god is the anorexia voice still draining. Just constant fear over food, Ive gotten pretty good at ignoring it, but some days its just too much. The guilt, the obsession, the double checking - all still there and active, and every day I have to continue ignoring it. And Ive gotten great at ignoring it, im at perfect ""health"" so I dont think any doctor will help me. Ive heard its possible, but not always the case, that anxiety meds can dampen the voice, is that true? I was wondering if I should just lie and say that I have GAD without depression and see if theyll give me something."
How to deal with chronic conditions that require cutting out food,"Hi, I was diagnosed with severe endometriosis when I was 19. Endometriosis can’t be cured, but only managed. The effectiveness of your management can effect your fertility, so as a married 26F this is very important to me to keep in tact. 

Essentially, low inflammation diet is the only management tool to prevent your ovarian cysts from growing or aggravating your symptoms. When I transitioned to being vegan, it managed my symptoms very effectively.  However, it nearly always triggered a relapse in my ED when I go vegan and initially start losing some weight due to the lifestyle change. 

I wondered if anyone else dealt with a chronic condition that effected what they were suppose to be eating and how do you deal with restrictive food prescriptions for one disease, while balancing your ED on the other hand.

Thank you for any advice"
35+ recovering from Anorexia,"Hi, I'm in the process of recovering from anorexia. Female in my late 30s. It's been 5 months since I got out of a Eating Disorder Unit as a resident. 

I was wondering if there's anyone else ""older"" that's on this recovery as well?

Right now, I'm maintaining according to my doctor, finally (well beyond weight restored which triggers anorexia thoughts from time to time). I don't think it's the set point yet. 

Has anyone gotten past the maintaining phase? Or is it permanent? It's very uncomfortable. I'm trying to be ok with it. But I'm really not. I'm basically twice what I lost, which makes me wish I had just been content before I got extreme."
Just had a baby 7 weeks ago,"TW illness, BMI talk

I've been in recovery on and off for 5 years. I had a relapse in between my 2 kids, oldest being 4 in August. I've got this new baby, and I'm getting over a really nasty mastitis infection. 
I've always been heavier than I looked, like dramatically, so my dysmorphia started young when I'd be weighed at school and for sports teams and have a high BMI, announced to everyone, while remaining on the the thin/busty side. 

Now I'm heavier, but still small, as is histrionic of my body. If anything, i have shapely thighs.  Everytime I get weighed at the doctor I get the BMI measured on the paper work and it says it's an overweight BMI. It messes with my head so much but I freaking work through it because I am in recovery goddamnit. I eat incredibly healthy, balanced, thought out and purposeful meals and get decent exercise. I want to be healthy for my kids more than anything. 


Thing is, people keep telling me how good I look for having had a baby, then follow it up with ""so thin!"" It drives me up a wall. I receive it politely then I fixate and really want to revert to my old ways. I know they mean well but I hate that this is said to me almost everywhere I go, by strangers, family, acquaintances. (My friends know so they don't say stuff like that, they ask how I am. My mom tries but apple doesn't fall far from the tree and I'm just thankful she's not competitive with me with weight loss anymore). I know it's probably not gonna stop. It's just wild because okay sure I'm small again fast but I'm also fighting an infection that almost turned into sepsis, riddled in IV ports, pale, shaky, facially kinda gaunt, and have dark circles. All well being technically ""overweight"". It's just gonna be forever and it drives me crazy. End rant."
“Toning up” in anorexia recovery-is it a good idea?,"Hi all,
This is my first post here and I’m kinda nervous and super cautious of anything I say being triggering so if I am in anyway please flag it up for me (nicely please🥺) so I know for future!

Basically, I started my recovery journey back at the beginning of the year but I was scared of actually putting on weight for a long time and it’s only recently I’ve managed to do that in a substantial way (albeit not a healthy one because I feel like it’s been mostly through binge eating and just stuffing myself with absolutely everything I’ve deprived myself of for the last few years but that’s another story).

Theoretically, I’m not terrified of the prospect of weight gain like I used to be. But as I do gain, even though I know weight distribution can be a little funky in the early stages, I am incredibly uncomfortable with how soft and round and just undefined (I guess? Not sure how else to put it without using a word which has kinda negative connotations) I look. Just feel like a bit of a blob tbh and I hate it. I know I would be a lot more comfortable with my skin if I toned up which wouldn’t necessarily require underreating or the excessive cardio I’m doing atm, more weights which I can’t see myself compulsively doing bc I’m not the biggest fan of that kind of thing. However, I would like to get my strength up so I think that would be a source of non-appearance driven motivation to try that. The toning up part would be the main driver though.

My question is whether this is a good idea at this point in my recovery. It’s not my intention to use it to lose weight but I can’t lie and say it’s not to do with bodily hang ups. I just feel so insecure looking bloated all the time and it makes me want to revert to restriction and trying to get more in shape seems like the only non-overtly disordered way of tackling this but there’s a guilty part of me which knows I should focus more on the whole radical acceptance thing. Any advice would be hugely appreciated."

Recovery Influencers?,"This might be a little weird, but I really found a lot of comfort with Jen Brett’s recovery content when she was making it.

Anorexia is like a ghost that has a chokehold on me,"- Also TW relapse-like thoughts

I suppose my disordered eating habits started around the age of 13. It‘s hard to tell because over the years the lines between „I think I have an ED“ and „I think I don‘t have an ED anymore“ got so blurred. 
I never seeked any help, never told anybody of it, so in some way, it‘s almost as if I made all of this up, which just adds to the conflict I have in my mind about it. 
I also suppose that at one point I truly was underweight. I know the measures I took for so long to reach unrealistic numbers. And it got better, surely did. 

But it‘s been 12 years and I still feel proud when I have gone a day without eating (be it because of stress or actually not feeling hungry or whatever). I still worry about eating something during the day when I know I‘m going out for dinner that night. I still feel bad after having enjoyed a big meal. I still know that there‘s always the option to purge, should I feel seriously bad about what I had just eaten. I still have the nagging thought that food is not nourishment but something that is just ought to make me gain weight. 

I eat normally these days and most of the time I enjoy it. And yet all of these things persist. I am starting to worry that my relationship with food may never truly heal. 

Somehow I needed to vent. Today was one of those days. I barely ate, worked out, and now I‘m fighting the urge to have a small snack before bed. Like going to sleep hungry is an accomplishment. 

Please, if anybody relates or has any tips or anything hopeful to say, send it my way. 


Thank you, have a lovely day/night."
Diet comments still trigger me,"I have been in recovery for about 5 years now, I've been doing especially good recently. I reached the goals the doctors put on for me about three years ago and have since worked very hard to maintain them. Recently a lot changed in my life and I've managed to encourage myself to not just do what's necessary to survive, but also push further to improve !
I've been addicted to sugar throughout all of this and a few weeks ago I decided to slowly reduce the quantities I consume. This is not a diet, I still eat what I need etc. I'm just trying to take more care of my body. So for example I replaced sodas with syrup water and slowly reduce the syrup. Processed sugar is destroying my teeth and overall health, I just want to be healthier and fitter. 
But every time I dare to mention it someone comments about how I'll get skinnier or guilts me that ""I don't need to loose weight unlike them"" etc. I'm not dieting, I just want to improve myself and take care of what little health I got left.
Sorry if this is triggering to some but I needed to vent as I've really worked hard to be at peace with myself and not focus on my weight etc.
I wish the best recovery to everyone here"
Consequences,"Hi!

I didn’t know if this post required a warning or not so I put one in case!

15F attempting to start recovery here, but I was wondering if being underweight/malnourished during puberty can interfere with physical and mental development? As in will I potentially stunt my pelvic bone or breast growth if I don’t try recovery and remain at my ‘restrictive weight’? Does anyone have any personal stories they’d be comfortable sharing? Thank you, and to anyone reading this I wish you all the best and loveliness in the world🫶"
Testosterone levels,"I know there isn’t many guys here but has anyone had low testosterone levels recover once they gained weight.
My levels went from 817 (anorexic) to 214 now that I’m recovering which makes no sense that I had higher levels when I was at a lower weight."
Financial eating disorder,"I struggle really badly with “financial anorexia”. I’m too scared to bring it up with my psychologist at the ED clinic because when I mentioned it at my evaluation, the person I spoke to just told me “hmm well it’s good to save money in times like these!!” Of course I agree but I treat money the way I’m treating food and I’m convinced the two are connected.

So I just wanted to ask, has anyone here suffered from “financial anorexia” and found that it has gotten better as your relationship with food has improved? 

I just want balance ffs😭"
where is my period??,"I have been in recovery for over 2 years now, but only really really intent recovery where i’ve stopped exercise and stuck to eating everything and anything for about 10 months. If gaining weight triggers you please stop reading here, but i’ve gained close to 20kg and i’m considered a very normal / healthy BMI and have been for a while but still no period!! I have very regular discharge, but no bleeding. Anyone had a similar experience? When did you period come back?"
When can I start doing cardio again?,"I’m 8 months in quasi recovery and 3 months “all in”. I’ve tried to stay away from high intensity workouts (I still hike about once a week, but hiking is a passion not something I do to modify my body in anyway). 

The thing is, I have wanted to do a marathon for years, but have not been able to due to my eating disorder. Finally doing a marathon is actually one of my biggest motivations to recover. 

But when can I start doing cardio again? My biggest concern is struggling to eat enough if I start burning more calories.."
When will the symptoms go away?,"I've been in real recovery for some time now (around almost 8 months).
Before that I had times where I started the recovery route but failed and went back into the fake comforting feeling ana gave me. 
During these times and also now I often have stomach and digestive issues. Mostly in the morning. My stomach hurts so much and it's making me feel ill to the point I don't feel hungry. I force myself to eat then.
I'm tired and bloated. Feeling weak and faint sometimes, even though I eat almost every two hours.  

I don't eat big meals but rather loads of small meals. During lunch I tend to have a big meal though. 
Even eating more than most of my friends, yet somehow am feeling like this. I don't get it.

So my question to you all is; 
When will the pain, digestive issue, weakness, bloating and other symptoms finally go away or rather get better?
It stresses me out."

School and recovery,"I started recovery three+ weeks ago and I’m going to school almost regularly. I missed some subjects tho.

how was recovery for you? what did it look and feel like?,"hi everyone! i’m 23 years old and started recovering at home 2-3 months ago after restricting a lot over the last 2 years. My decision to recover was mostly due to the fact that friends and family were starting to express concern after I hit my lowest weight.

i’m eating double the amount of calories I need for maintenance, but tbh my body feels worse in recovery than it did during my eating disorder. I typically nap for hours after meals, I feel so fatigued and sore throughout the day and my chest hurts especially after meals. is this normal for the first couple months? i’m seeing a doctor next week but would appreciate other peoples input, thank you!"
How do you go on a diet as a recovering anorexic,I recovered from anorexia 2 years ago and have been going strong and recently I’ve decided to go on a diet for my up coming holiday! And now I feel all this old crap coming back up where I have break downs from food and obsessed completely about what I eat and how I look. And I just don’t know how to fight that off I want to keep going strong on my recovery but surely I could still go on a diet to loose a little bit for a holiday without all of this. Any advice?
Hi everyone. I’ve made this video to share my insight into some of the misconceptions around addiction. These can be infuriating… I’ve dealt with bulimia and an addiction to binge eating for years (I know there’s a difference with anorexia). I hope you can relate to some of this and garner value 🙏,
TikTok feed is triggering my ED and I feel really bad about it.,"I feel so bad, When I look at tiktoks of extremely overweight people my ED triggers so badly, and I know that's so wrong. Because it's not my body, I don't have any right to judge these people or feel disgusted by a body that's not mine. I feel so wrong and sad about feeling scared of becoming like them, I'm recovering, I have been eating good for almost  half a year now but suddenly my TikTok feed started suggesting to me tiktoks of body positivity and extremely overweight people doing average things. It triggered me so badly and I feel so bad about it, I understand there's nothing wrong about being overweight or having certain accomodations for your body size, but I couldn't help but feel extreme fear over becoming so big I have to ask for accomodations and I feel so wrong for that, I know it's so wrong to feel disgusted by bodies that are not mine."
I recovered…my friend now has an ED,"So in highschool I had a restrictive ED (which I hid from everyone) I was a cross country/track runner very toned and slim and always got complements on my body. I had a shit time with food and my anxiety was out of control. My friend who was also a runner was bigger then me and always making comments about how she was insecure about her body and wants to be skinnier (she was only eating 1 meal a day, and I always encouraged her to eat properly and told her her body is perfect how it is) last fall we both left for uni and I recovered fully, i put on probably 15lbs but I feel absolutely no anxiety around food and many other things in my life so recovering gave me a lot of peace. Since I am heavier, I’m insecure with my body now. My friend on the other hand in uni developed an ED. She lost a ton of weight and it’s noticeable and she’s getting many complements from our friends on how great she looks… this sounds so awful but I’m so envious of her body now and the fact that she’s skinnier then me, I want to start restricting and running a lot again but a part of me knows that I need to preserve the recovery I worked for. I really don’t know what to do, if anyone reads this I really appreciate it❤️(also I wanna make sure my friend okay, we were at a restaurant yesterday and she went to the washroom right after the meal…:("
In need of friends,"Hi, I am 19 and have been struggling with anorexia for many years, and right now, I am at the lowest point in my attempt to recover. I have lost all my friends, my family avoids me, nothing makes me happy. I have no hobbies and I spend my days sitting at home doing nothing. 
I thought I could maybe find a pen pal here who is having the same problems, so that I don’t go crazy and end it all. 
If you feel lonely and are looking for a friend as well, please, let me know and we can get to know each other 🥲"
"""oh that's why...!"" T.W.","I need to get this off my chest, but I don't want to talk to my boyfriend because I know he'll be mad at my teacher and my mom will just say ""forget it"" or ""don't mind it"" And I really need someone to listen to me and understand my feelings.

Today I went out to buy food outside my university, I was hungry and of course I was extremely willing and proud because I finally reflected in favor of my recovery and above all I said to myself ""I'll focus on rewiring, if I gain weight what does it matter?"" Just when I was going back to my classroom, I bumped into one of my teachers and he said ""Oh! Enjoy your meal"" I thanked and went on my way but the conversation continued ""so that's why you looks chubby now!""

AND then... My hunger disappeared and my heart squeezed, I felt hurt, disgusted and betrayed, ashamed and humiliated, now I just want to lose weight and get back to my lowest weight... That's why I didn't want to recover....

I don't want opinions or ""oh don't listen to them!"" Or shit, I just want to get it off my chest."

"I'm trying to recover, but thyroid tumor makes it really hard and I feel bad","(Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my native language) Hello guys, I was trying to recover since october, but couldn't. At first everyone was saying that I didn't try enough (and my therapist was looking at me as if I was lying to her about eating way more than I should for my weight and height) and I felt like a terrible person for making no progress. Recently during a check-up doctor found a lump on my thyroid which meant that I had thyroid tumor causing my body to need way more food to function. So I was trying to eat more, every time feeling really, really terrible, but I still haven't made any progress. I know that the time is ticking and every month of staying underweight makes consequences for my body more severe, but I don't even know how much should i eat, also even though my therapist believes me now, my family kind of doesn't care and only wants me to be ""normal"". I don't think they believe that problems with my thyroid are related to my problems with weight, my mom often says that my lack of progress means that I'm not trying enough. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but I feel so much fear, I feel so, so helpless. I'll try to eat even more since today, but even thinking about it fills me with so much dread"

FBT guys hang in there ✊," 2 months ago I made a conscious decision to gain weight and get better and damn it was the best decision. My parents have ceased to control me from the word at all. I go in for sports (in moderation), gain weight at an adequate rate and eat on a surplus, building my diet myself and controlling the process. literally in April it was all just a dream. my therapist did nothing to help me and only made things worse. she ONLY talked about food and was always coming in with nutritional advice. well, and of course she said that I had no right to choose food, imposing eternal control on my parents. they had to sit with me 2 hours after eating. I was banned from the phone, I went to the bathroom ONLY with my mother (even to the toilet). I could not move normally, they timed when and how much I should walk. up to the point that I had to send photos with friends to report to my mother. one day my father came to a coffee shop where my lfriend and I were sitting and started asking the waiters what table we were sitting at and how long we were there. I was driven home, calling every 10 minutes. I tried to hide it from my friends, but I saw that they understood what was going on. some just started ignoring me, and I can understand them too. I constantly lied to my parents. running, throwing away food, burning calories. I hid it literally everywhere. everything got to the point that my mother sat with"
gastro concerns,"Hello! I was curious if anyone had suggestions on which doctors outside of
mental health professionals might be of use initiating physical recovery. I’m set to start therapy and psychiatry again in August (there is a waitlist) but I know I am having horrendous stomach problems and want to address them with a doctor before August. This next bit will be a bit gross, so read at your own discretion about my poop. 
I’ve had anorexia for about 8 years (I’m a 20 year old FTM man)  and have worked mentally on the topic many times, but I am having issues like a hiatial hernia in my stomach, worse than usual acid reflux (I’ve had this a long time, but it has ramped up lately) and I have been shitting my brains out since October with a few weeks of peace sometimes lmfao."
Puberty after anorexia,"So, I was severely underweight during my puberty, but now I think I am finally recovered. But recently I think my hormones are going back. I'm not mad about it , I'm so happy because I have the chance to look like a grown woman, but now I feel myself so bad in my body. I'm 18 and literally in one day my left boob grown so much. I thought it will even out maybe in one or two week but it didn't, my left one got even bigger. Now it's about one and a half cup bigger than the other and really sore. I didn't have any boobs because of my illness but at least it was even, not a cantaloupe and a cherry.😂

Anyone doing FBT?,"Hi all,
I was just wondering if anyone else is currently doing FBT/your experience. 
For context, my parents are very loving and kind, but this ED has really taken a toll on us as a family. My dad is pretty knowledgeable in how ED works but my mom is the opposite— she constantly says that I am severely underweight (I have been gaining weight for 3 months), comments on my body during meal times, and always looks at my body and makes judgemental remarks. I know she means well and I truly love her, but this is frustrating since my dad is allowing her to plate my meals. I feel like I'm just some sort of punching bag for her to take her anger out on, and she's using food to hurt me while disguising if as trying to help. I know all of the things she's doing and saying are right bc I'm trying to recover, but it's just very dehumanizing— it feels like my feelings and thoughts are invalid. Any thoughts on this?"
New food aversions in recovery,"I always have had a big appetite and liked the taste of most foods. Even when I was pretty sick, I craved almost all foods. Since being in recovery, at age 29, I’ve developed all of these food aversions. My appetite sucks (never an issue in the past) and I’m grossed out by so many foods that I used to enjoy. Anyone ever have this experience and what do you think about why it happens ?"

Growing taller at 23 (M) after anorexia recovery?,"I’m a male, 23 years. I had anorexia from 16 to 22 and it temporarly stopped my development so I still look quite young (like a teenager, little facial hair) but since I recovered I grew about 1-2 inches and I wonder if it is possible to grow more if I continue eating and not restricting? 

Given that I just started growing a beard at age 22/23 I think that my body is still developing? But I also read that men usually stop growing at 20?"
Being hungry and full feels the same...,"I've been trying to ""honor my hunger"" for almost a week now, and I can't figure out whether I'm hungry or full. At first I assumed everything was hungry and kept eating, but then I'd get very uncomfortable and panic. I'm realizing that I'm just not aware of my stomach at all, in general, so for me ""awareness"" (i.e., being hungry or being too full) feels the same. I'm just noticing that something is going on, but I can't distinguish the two. I don't want to stuff myself, but I'm terrified of undereating by accident. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you figure out the difference?"

"Weight restored, eating normally- appetite suddenly gone???","I’ve been weight restored and maintaining weight for 4 months now. I have the help of a therapist. I am really struggling with my appetite all of a sudden. I pushed past the initial weight restoration phases like lack of hunger, eating everything in sight etc. this feels a little different- like I just don’t get hungry. I’m a bit worried it’s a bad sign like my metabolism is broken?? I try to eat small calorie heavy meals when I feel like this. But it’s so weird!! I want to know if this has happened to anyone else and whyyyy??

Also, I would like to note, I’m continuing eating as normally as I can despite this, I’ve come too far to go off track now!!"
Update? My body is adjusting maybe?,So idk what's going on... I'm eating and my stomach is getting smaller and my abs are showing again. But I mainly eat soft foods and junk because I'm struggling financially and really really not doing well in that aspect and can't afford decent food and also can't really cook for myself being autistic it's all I can do to slap a piece of bologna on some bread sometimes😅 so basically I keep diarrhea. But I am eating a lot and my boobs are coming back and my hair is growing and I feel better I'm just worried I'm losing weight and back tracking even though I'm terrified of back tracking and scarf down as much as I can to try to avoid losing weight😅 but idk if it's just my body adjusting and redistributing fat or what😅 Thanks for reading and I hope everyone is doing well🥰
Mum is not respecting me,"My mum always uses language such as “you HAVE to HAVE some OF x” or “you ARE eating y”. I tried to explain respecting to her that my ED doesn’t like to feel like I don’t have free will and whenever she implies that I must eat something I am less likely to eat it. I asked her to either say “x is for dinner tonight” because then 1. I am more likely to NOT FIGHT EATING it and 2. I feel like I get to make THE recovery forward decision for myself. BTW I am 18+ thus recovery is MY CHOICE. Her response is to shut down or say “fine I don’t care, starve then“. Like she goes from 1 to 100, super controlling to careless. It’s triggering, stressful, and manipulative. I want her to support me in recovery but not tell me what to do and go off on a power/control high. How do I deal with this? It’s triggering and toxic and not supportive of my recovery at all."
How can I lose weight in a proper/healthy way?,"Hi everyone, I’m so glad I found this subreddit. 

TW - I do mention numbers, and marijuana use for eating help

I’ve always been overweight to some degree, but after high school I began taking lexapro and had significant weight gain. I also started eating much more poorly and became inactive and eventually got to the point where I was significantly obese. I struggled with thoughts of EDs before ever having one, and attempted to make myself bulimic when I was younger. Eventually the thoughts became more overwhelming, and when I got serious about losing weight I got a little carried away. I became very obsessed with exercising and counting my calories. I began losing weight which just strengthened my obsession, on top of dating a guy who encouraged my poor habits and pushed me further into an ED. I eventually became anorexic, I stopped eating all together and worked out for hours every day until I lost 100lbs. I was so happy with my success, but a friend reached out to some medical professionals and they began helping me with my ED. After moving to a new area I got a new doctor who prescribed medical marijuana for anxiety and depression, as well as to help prompt me to eat. I began relying on the marijuana, and ended up gaining about 30lbs back.
I’m engaged now and getting married soon, and these thoughts are creeping back up. I’ve become super self conscious again, and I hate how I look. I already have body dysmorphia, and I feel like it’s so heightened right now. 
I’ve stopped smoking, which in turn has made me stop eating. I’ve been wanting to start losing weight again, especially for my wedding, but I have no idea how to safely do so without spiraling back to where I was before. I want to lose weight, but in a health and proper way. My fiancé is very helpful with trying to prompt me to eat, but some days I don’t even think about it. I literally just forget to eat, which then makes it easier for me to continue to not eat. 

Anyway, TLDR: I just need support on how to lose weight in a healthy way without sending me back into anorexia."
My stomach hurts so badly help,"Anytime i eat anything more than a loght snack my stomach [lower and upper abdominal area] BLOAT UP and i feel like im dying.
Whyyyy and how do i kake it stop. This pain is unbearable and im thinking bout starving just to not have this pain afterwards."
I had toast and pb on top of my normal breakfast and I feel guilty but proud,
got my period back,it’s just a little spotting for the last 4 days but i think it’s still my first period in about a year and a half. :) this started from choosing to eat two meals a day for the last 3 months consistently
monte nido reviews?,"hey y’all. i am a neuro divergent trans-masc nonbinary person struggling with anorexia. im finally reaching out for support and treatment, and looking for input. i saw very mixed reviews about the Monte Nido group, and hoping to get input from y’all. thanks in advance💜"
Ed is screaming,"I have been trying to stop my anorexic behaviors for the last several years. I find intuitive eating a hit or miss depending on my feeling. So I am trapped in sadness and don't forsee it leaving anytime soon. The body dysmorphia feels like it's setting in again and I feel desolate. 

I went to my EDA meeting today I found hope in my fellows in recovery and their milestones. Yet ED (my eating disorder)  just won't stop nagging me with stinky thinking. I am very much under calories today and yesterday.  On Monday I was weighed which was bitter sweet. First I guessed my correct number and then I looked at the scale. Then the sadness of this number weighed in shortly after. Ed's logic I need to be at a very different number. However, here's my healing when I was at the number I still couldn't love my body. Ed took that expierence away because I obsessively thought about my size and how to stay there. These thoughts feel like the ocean, my sponsor gave me the analogy that I need to keep floating until I find land. If I fight the thoughts they drown me, if I let them go like waves and just float they will pass. However, I am not thriving there.  My behaviors keeps changing but the insanity of Ed keeps going. Devine intervention the irony I recently had an issue with my insurance and my mental health services are suspended until they sort out paperwork. This feels like the universe saying if your not willing to get better I'll take your guard rails down.Do this yourself....and I just am struggling with this idea that I need to let all these thoughts go because that number won't make me feel better. To add to it other people's opinions as in Giseles story are the little things that I am allowed to let go of so I can focus on the root issues. 

I made this post because I feel like I am on a slip and slid to restricting. I have not been able on my own to not restrict when these feelings surface and so saying all this here feels validating that depriving myself of nutrients is not the answer to my problems. That's just stinky thinking."
Flexibility Issues,"I was at the gym this Sunday doing box jumps and I think I sprained my lower back - which never happened before and frankly, felt embarrassing as I used to be quite flexible and agile. Should I be concerned? Interestingly enough, my flexibility was at its greatest when I was severely underweight."
relapsing….,"for context I struggled with ana for a few years, but started recovery June of 2022 and have been weight-restored since October 22.

But I’ve recently started counting calories again and weighing myself every morning. I’m drinking coffee and diet drinks to get rid of my hunger and have been restricting to a low amount (I don’t want to put numbers here to violate rules but it’s pretty low).

I feel miserable, and my anxiety is becoming awful again. I’ve lost too much weight in just 2 weeks which isn’t natural. I also lost my period again about a month ago so I know I’m doing something wrong again. I don’t want to be like this because I know I’m just damaging my metabolism and making it harder for myself to actually maintain a healthy weight and not be over/underweight, but it’s just so hard to fight off that voice in my head, because when I see the numbers go down on the scale it’s like this sick high.

This sounds more like a vent post ik, but for anyone that has relapsed and pulled out of it, what was your experience? Just looking for some advice to try to figure myself out."
always bloated ; freakin out!!,i’m very early into recovery and i’m bloated constantly like really badly and i know why this is happening and it’s just the only way my body can react but for those who are recovered/in recovery when did the bloating stop or when did it start to subside? it’s been sooo emotionally distressing i can’t even let my bf touch my stomach and it’s also so painful since my digestive system is also very slow . kinda just need some reassurance or some tips on how to stop it/help it  ?
"My biggest regret in ""recovery""","i call it ""recovery"" because while my experience lead me to be physically healthier, i wasted my time not letting myself recover from this mentally. let me preface this by saying my mentality is still so bad, and that's why i regret how i went about trying to heal physically. please heed the tw, because this is coming from someone not fully recovered. 

i never went ""all in"", because i never wanted to recovery fully. my motivation was my family, and because they were external factors, i couldn't help but tell myself that once i reached a weight they would be happier with, i'd let myself relapse. while trying to gain weight, i never let myself give in to my cravings completely. sure, i had more food than usual which is how i'm now at a physically healthy weight, but i still counted in my head. even if i was hungry, i'd convince myself i wasn't hungry, it's only like that because how much i'd messed up my hunger cues. i told myself i'd give myself high-calorie challenges, like five times what i had when actively restricting, but everytime it came down to it, i'd give excuses why that day i couldn't eat to my heart's content.

my biggest regrets are not using this chance to change my mindset, and also not letting myself satisfy all my cravings and hunger when i had the chance. maybe it's not too late to do just that, but my appetite has always been naturally quite small, so after many months of me being at a healthy weight, i don't experience eh symptoms anymore. i'm sharing this with the hopes that anyone contemplating ""quasi recovery"", or whether or not to go ""all in"" will make a choice that benefits them physically and mentally, without any regrets. 

people say food is the best medicine for a person going through ed, and i agree because i didn't get enough of it back then, and i'm not ready to let go of ed thoughts; i'm not recovered even if i may look like it. please have food to fuel your body and be healthy. have food to be happy and live without regrets. have food because everyone deserves it (unless you've intentionally starved a helpless fella and don't repent then... maybe not), even though you don't actually need to earn the right to eat (ofc discounting the cost of food, etc.)."
Trying not to relapse TW,"I’ve been recovered since 2021 from anorexia and bulimia but I am struggling so hard right now. I developed POTS and other weird issues after having COVID and it’s ruined my ability to exercise which was my saving grace during recovery. I’ve had some changes in my body because of this and I’m having a really hard time coping. I know that if I relapse it’s just going to make all my symptoms of my long covid worse but I just feel so negatively about my body lately. 
Any words of encouragement are appreciated."
Not getting better,"Does anyone else feel like they’re not getting better at all despite doing everything they can? I’m over a year in recovery and gained a lot of weight. My symptoms have definitely improved a lot but I’ve hit a hurdle where I still have some symptoms that are lingering and getting in the way of things. I’ve got really bad digestive issues still, fatigue, someone body aches. I sometimes still get lightheaded too (not as often as before but it stills happens sometimes). I still feel pretty weak. I’m seeing a GI doctor at the end of the month, but doctors have never been able to help me in the past no matter how many tests I get done. I’m not sure what else I can do for myself? I’ve tried a bunch of vitamins and supplements too. Idk how to tell if I should just wait it out longer or keep actively looking for answers?"
having a triggering week,"This week has been really hard for me after seeing that I have had unintentional weight gain. Now I'm hyper aware of  what I look like and my body and what i eat. Theres so much guilt and discomfort and Im overthinking so much and crying more. Ive been doing well in recovery but now that im on my own with the whole eating thing, I cant stand if I gain more than I needed to. Too be honest i  dont care to hear about how overshoot is normal. i just want to learn how to deal w all these feelings and anxieties. eating is so scary to me now and i feel like the only thing that will make me feel better is if i lose some of the weight and eat a little less."
Comparing,"Hi guys I'm just looking for advice/people who understand
I (16F) am recovering or trying to at least however i find myself constantly comparing what I eat to what my brother eats ,my parents put so much focus on my food that I feel like my brother is allowed alot more freedom.How do you stip the urge to eat less than those around you ."
10K Calorie Challenge,"

So, I made a post last week about attempting the 10K calorie challenge. I did it. It was the best fucking day ever.

grieving,"i found my partner dead of an overdose  on may 20th. we had both just gotten out of rehab. i’ve been at a healthy weight since 2015 but of course still wishing i could be under. now that i am from the addiction and the grief, i just feel empty. in fact i feel disappointed in myself for slipping up. he loved my curves, and was so excited to cook or get food for me every day. do i just have to accept that i have no appetite for now and that eating will come again, in time? can anyone else relate?"
Nonstop bingeing,"I'm in recovery and at a normal/higher weight but I still have extreme urges to binge. Physically I feel rarely hungry but mentally all the damn time. Today I ate close around 20k calories (yes, really). I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone else experienced this?"
Do we all have to go through this?,"Hi, about 1,5 years ago I started to lose a lot of weight and I developed anorexia nervosa. The last few weeks were awful. I was tired all the time, I couldn't barely move and I noticed to lose hairs. This was the final straw for me. Since Friday I started to eat regularly. >!I now eat breakfast (oatmeal + whole grain bread + some fruits) and a little bit for lunch (fruits and nuts). For dinner, I did not change anything because I always ate a good dinner (potatoes or pasta or vegetables with something else). In the evening I eat some fruits and curd.!<

I feel much better, I have a lot more energy which motivates me to continue. The only thing that ""worries"" me is my weight gain. It sounds stupid, but in only those 3 days I gained >!2kg!< of weight. I guess this is exactly what I want and what I need, but it's still hard to accept, if you know what I mean. I'm also worried that I gain so much weight that it won't stop and that I get fat super fast. Sounds stupid?!

>!I have to say, I still do my daily workout (10km runs),!< which are feeling so good now again since I have a lot more energy. This is also something which motivates me to eat regularly. Is this normal? What could/should I do? Thank you very much"
I got my period back so early,"I’ve been in recovery for about 5 months. I’ve been doing well, steadily gaining weight. I got my period back last month (it was gone for about 5 months) and just got it again so it seems it’s already pretty bang on regular. It only took about 6 weeks of me eating properly to get it back. I’ve only gained half of the weight my team wants me to. I know I should be happy, I know not everyone loses their period even at severely underweight. But it makes me want to cry, I feel like this means I should stop gaining weight. What if this is my healthy weight, and not the one they want me to reach? I can’t trust my team no matter how hard I try"
I want to tell my mom since shes basically my only friend atm.,"tw! (i wanted to post on here because i do not wanna be on the other ed subreddits) im worried if im at a healthy weight ill be unhappy because ill be able to focus on what i look like/how unhappy i am instead of fixating on the ed. now my mom is cooking me stuff and making me eat fattening food which kind of makes me resent her but i know she means well. I hate saying this because she is amazing but doesn't think i have an eating disorder only that i was dieting for so long that i got carried away. i was told i was too skinny and asked by many (not friends tho :/) if i was eating enough. That made me want to gain some weight because i guess i looked sickly. my brain fog, and anxiety was really bad but now its just anxiety. i want to tell my mom everything. about how terribly i lived for the past 5 months, and how bad my anxiety is getting. Im anxious, because my ed is a banging, thought thats always screaming at me telling me i should do x. because of that it makes me anxious about basically the day progressing and how much longer i have to wait until i eat which i dont look forward to. i want to get better but honestly i feel like other girls my age dont eat that much either, and im not sure what an actual teen girl my age eats. im eating 3 meals a day but I'm worried that my metabolism will be messed up, that i wont have time to exercise, and that even when I've eaten enough that the thoughts of ""eat more!!"" will still be in my head. anorexia has taken so much away from me that i forgot what i like. even now the only thing that interests me is anorexia health risks, and gym wieiad. i want my life to not focus on stuff like that but ive honestly forgotten what it feels like because i honestly didnt have much of a life other than being severely depressed. how should i tell my mom the truth without her forcing me into a clinic or making me eat an insane amount?"

recovered but accidentally undereating,"hi guys:)

i almost always believe that people who are truly recovered dont bang on + post about it, because of the competitive nature of EDs. i've been 100% recovered for years now after years of struggling and being sectioned etc. it took a long time, and i have other mental issues, but one day i realised that i don't let food control any of my life anymore and can finally enjoy a normal life where i don't punish my body. a big part of that was getting weight restored (against my will but after all this time i can say it was deffo the best medicine), deleting any ana accounts and things that reminded me of it and spending more time with my mum. i really recommend:)

recently my problem is that, with a really intense degree, i genuinely don't have money/time to get food during exam seasons, and the exam stress lowers my appetite. i won't go into details but i end up accidentally undereating a lot and it affects my health (sick, weak, tired, not sleeping, depressed, etc). i've just come home from uni and never get to eat because i'm constantly at work, and when i'm not, it's hard to make food bc of my weird home situation.

i look gaunt and i get that horrible frail/faint feeling i used to get and it makes me want to cry every day because there's no way i'm going back to that life again. any advice for managing stress and finding convenient foods for a busy life? is it possible i'm actually slipping back into bad habits to cope with stress, despite years of recovery?

wishing you all the best xx"
Celebs being open about ed’s,"Does anyone agree with this ,  I understand being open with followers but saying guys I have a eating disorder then literally showing off your thinness and basically showing off yay I’m glad not eating works. I don’t understand being open about eating disorders if you aren’t going to openly recover from it as-well. I think one example of this is nessa barret she openly talks about how she has a eating disorder but then literally deliberately shows how thin she is . It’s basically promoting it, charli damelio said she has one too - I don’t see the point in letting people know you have a eating disorder if you aren’t already recovered from it and will tell people how bad it is! The most annoying thing everrrrrr"
how to safely start gaining weight without medical help?,my bmi is 12.3 and I want to start gaining weight to get my life back but I’ve heard of  something called “refeeding syndrome” and I’m scared of the complications that will happen if I suddenly start eating “normally”. how many calories should I start with and how do I gradually increase it or know when it’s safe to do so?
"""junk"" foods","I (16F) was in treatment last year and recovered however i never truly recovered because i got to my goal weight by only binging on cereal ,chips , chocolate,etc.

so sick of it,I'm so sick of nearly fainting everytime I stand . when I'm not eating it's the only time I feel relief mentally. it's the only time I feel likw I'm doing something right
Inpatient,"As someone who is desperate to please, I always did well in inpatient programs. I ate almost everything, stayed the whole time, was compliant, gained the weight, etc etc. Now, after a mini relapse, I can’t get myself to do it alone.

Doctors,Hello does anyone know any doctors that specialize in anorexia recovery. I been recovering for a couple of months but I’m experiencing some very bad symptoms.
Extreme hunger,"I am currently experiencing extreme hunger and can't stop eating even though I am uncomfortably full. I have gained quite a significant amount of weight and I feel so anxious about it. Despite this, I just can't seem to stop eating past fullness and it really frustrates me. I am worried I will continue to gain weight and feel like I look “big” again. My mental health has become so bad because of this and I feel like a failure. It feels more like I have gone from anorexia to a binge eating disorder. I feel so ashamed about my extreme hunger and just want it to stop. Does anyone know how long it will continue? I really don't know what to do. I feel so ashamed to talk about this with my family. Even writing it here feels humiliating."
Does anyone else experience this?,I've been in recovery a few months following a meal plan but every night after I finish my meal and snack I go straight to bed no matter what the time is even if it's really early as I feel like there's nothing left to do so I might as well go to sleep. I was wondering if anyone else has had this or have any tips on how to make it go away?
How did you quit the scale?,"I’m just now coming to terms with the fact that I’m addicted to the scale. I weigh myself far too often and the number truly dictates my mood. For me, it’s a compulsion. It’s like as soon as I get the idea to check my weight in my head, I have to go and do it. In the past, and with a lot of time and effort, I was able to get rid of other ED behaviours. Yet I’ve tried everything I could to quit the scale and I always go back to it. And I’m realizing it’s holding me back from recovery. 


Does anyone have advice, or could you tell me how you approached this and what has worked for you?"
Itchy Skin?,"I am wondering if anyone else on here has experienced intensely itchy skin in recovery. It is all over my body and feels like pins and needles. I live in a place where the weather is warming up, so my veins are popping like crazy. I don’t know if that’s related either. I’m also doing trauma work. I guess it would just be nice to know if this could be a typical response to any of the above things."
"I tried on my “skinny” dresses, and my tummy STICKS out","The worst thing is, overall I have not gained that much and the dresses looks good with the exception off my tummy poch is sticking out and it looks like I’m pregnant 🤰and my face is bloated. I’ve been in quasi recovery since October and full in recovery just for two months but I honestly just want a flat stomach back :( I know it can take about 6 months- 1 year for weight redistribution but this is really messing me up and affecting my work life and social life.."
Overheating after meals?,"I feel like Im overheating after meals. 

Not sweating but just radiating heat. My hands are soo warm, my veins pop out of my arms like crazy and my breath is so hot it fogs up my glasses when I hold my hand to my mouth. Does anyone else have this? Is it normal?"
Set point weight,"I'm not working with an ed team right now because I can't find one that's under my insurance. So I'm just asking this here to get feedback from people that've been there 

How do you know when you've hit your set point weight for your body? After I left PHP, I just went all in and gave in to all my mental extreme hunger cues. It was crazy, all I could think about was food and I'd wake up in the middle of the night to eat random shit. I gained some more weight and now the mental hunger is just gone completely. I'm not obsessing over food anymore, though I don't really have any appetite at all, but not because of restricting. I still don't have actual hunger cues. But I feel like I have more energy and my mental functioning is better at least. I'm able to eat and stop and feel fine with it 

I'm very close to the weight my body has always bounced back to and has been since I was a teenager (but that's when my ed started so it confuses me if this is my real weight or not). I'm technically still underweight so it confuses me so much 

What are signs that your body is actually happy with your weight? Or should I take this as, my weight is stable and if my body asks for more, I should honor it"
unable to go out without mask,"ever since i got used to wearing a mask due to covid, i've gotten so used to being able to cover my face. there was point of time when i was totally fine without a mask after covid eased up, but now i'm getting all these disordered thoughts again that i feel so fat without a mask. it feels worse since i'm schooling, so i feel like people whom i interact with will notice how fat my face is. 

it's especially bad today because i had a bigger than usual lunch and dinner yesterday, i ate something this morning before going out. it was only once i was out did i realise i forgot to wear a mask (which is fine in my country). i told myself it would be fine to eat because i would have a mask to cover up afterwards but now i don't have it so i feel so uncomfortable."
how can I start recovering on my own?,"uhh hi. 
this is my first time ever opening up about having anorexia nervosa - I was officially diagnosed last year when I was sent to emergency and was inpatient for two months. I wasn’t professionally released rather my parents took me out early against the “doctors’ advice” because they saw me get even more depressed by the day - in other words, I was still underweight when I got out. for the first couple months I continued recovery at home with my parents but truthfully, as each month passed and I got more control for my meals, snacks, etc, I slowly started falling back into old ed habits. about 5 months ago, after a huge argument broke out between me and my parents because they started noticing I was looking unwell again, they weighed me. I’m new to this so I have no idea if it’s against the rules to put in numbers so I’ll just say when they weighed me after months of not weighing me, I lost a lot of weight. I was basically close to the weight that got me sent to emergency. since then, I told my parents I’ll try to recover and gain weight on my own because I want to beat anorexia on my own but truthfully, I haven’t been fully committed so I’m still at the same weight. I’m scared I’ll lose even more weight and get sent to inpatient again but I just can’t seem to make myself gain weight. how can I start recovering? how can I recover on my own?"
it just sucks,"im not saying recovery isn't the right option, im not saying i regret it, but i also am not glad i did, it's weird

i've been weight restored for about two years, i've been doing the right things and keeping my mind in a normal environment, not letting myself take in like ed focused content or sad music etc etc, i can tell that my ed brain is like gone, like the physical fear of food like getting panic attacks and stuff, i eat and crave food, etc

it's just my head and all i've done since recovery is live a life almost trying to protect myself and hide, i can't wear most clothes, i try to but i can't, i always have to be in the baggiest shit even in summer, i can't enjoy things because im constantly thinking abt how big i look, i have consistent panic attacks over how my body feels and looks, i never feel the urge to do anything fun because i don't wanna deal w being perceived, it just sucks cuz like i hate to say this but even when i was ill i would find times i felt rly happy and confident and have good days, and ever since i recovered i haven't had a good day, im so tired and i know relapse isn't the answer cuz it just restarts this cycle it just sucks, i have tried so hard to do therapy and be better w how i feel and positive self talk like i SWEARR i have but i feel so useless and like i'm wasting my life but i can't stop mourning

not rly asking for advice bc there isn't rly any but just wanted to vent, maybe if anyone relates idk, thx for reading"
Im 24 tommorow.,"This is ridiculous. Ive let myself get bad again. I need to step it up and stop restricting and start really trying again. Maybe get back into therapy. Either way enough is enough. I’m 24 and need to get my shit together. I know its gonna be hard but it needs to be done. I can’t let myself keep saying “tommorow” or letting myself continue living like this becuase its “too hard.” Someone needs to be an adult and nobody’s gonna do it for me or check up on me, its gotta be me. Its gonna be shitty though. I hate eating and cooking and grocery shopping and my stomach and brain are gonna hurt. But i need to do it anyway. Any advice welcome. Thanks for reading."
I thought I was getting better,I'm disappointed in myself this week. I kept myself away from the scale and haven't been wearing my watch so I wouldn't count calories as much. I thought I was doing better but but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't restricting while I'm by myself. My boyfriend said he was getting worried because I was looking thinner and I'm mad that a sick part of me got excited when he said that. I was scared to check my weight because I don't see it in the mirror but I had to today and I was confused because I could have sworn that I gained weight when in reality I've lost a lot more than I thought I did. The rational part of me is mad at myself for letting it get to this point but my sickness counted it as a victory. I'm trying to seek help but It feels like there are 2 of me battling for control the part of me that doesn't want to live like this anymore and the voice I thought was a friend but who slowly became a tyrant in my head. I'm scared I won't ever get better.
Finished my plate at work today!,"I always feel judged when eating in public and have struggled with finishing my plate for the longest time. Today I finished my pre-made lunch while at work! No need to hide anything, no shame. I must have looked like a right idiot smiling at my plate like that but I was so proud. 

And guess what, nobody cared!
No judgy looks, no mean comments, I actually felt like I was part of the group now. My ED is a f*cking liar!"
i am happy to eat,"i went so long before and during recovery not being able to eat happily. like ofc i enjoyed eating, but i never understood how people wld dance when they ate or get excited to eat.. but now im starting to get that feeling again :)) i am happy to eat foods i enjoy w little to no anxiety even if they r fear foods .. this is such a win for me"
ulcerative colitis' stomach pains and relapse,I am afraid that whatever I eat will cause stomach pains and at the same time I have a mental urge (maybe because of extreme hunger?). what to do? i feel like i'm going crazy
is it just me or are ed’s still incredibly taboo?,i love this subreddit because i feel like this is one of the very few spaces online where you can be honest about your experience wether mental or physical. i’ve always felt like the conversation on the internet when it comes to ed’s is very limited and hyper positive and doesn’t allow room to discuss the real and tough parts because then it becomes “too much/too dark” when really that’s just what the disorder is.  i feel like the line is drawn too thin between a trauma dump and a sick person posting something triggering and then stuff we’ve heard a thousand times abt how amazing recovery is and “eat you deserve it” like mantras but then there’s hush around talking abt the real parts . this subreddit draws the line perfectly and i wish there was a shift in attitude in the way people talk about anorexia. anyways my point is ed awareness needs to be taken more seriously and i feel like that starts with a less shameful attitude around the hard parts.
stomach pain causes me to relapse,"I (23F) have been in recovery for like 2 years. I haven’t gotten any help for it i’ve just been trying to eat on my own. For the most part i think i’ve been doing pretty good, but i have a reoccurring problem. My stomach hurts often like if feel like it’s full of acid. This mostly starts in the morning and i have to push myself to eat breakfast and it slowly get better throughout the day, most of the time. When i go out with my friends and drink the next morning my stomach is in so much pain and it’s so hard to eat. this will often spiral into me barley eating for a couple days. Usually i’d just smoke weed and that would help but i’m also trying to cut back on weed so i’m not sure what to do except slowly feed myself crackers and fruit until i can stomach eating more filling food. does anyone else struggle with this? if so what do u do to help? i’m so sick of it and i feel like no one around me gets it."
I think i am never getting my metabolism like it used go be or my gut and I can’t stop crying. I’m having digestive problems.,Pls help with tips to help my metabolism to be faster and heal my gut
got rid of hoarder stash,it’s been about a month i wuld say tht i got rid of it ? i have been for the last two years consistently keeping a stash of food i usually never eat (it goes bad and it has caused a lot of overall just sanitary unlivable conditions just within my own bedroom). it’s daunting to be without it as it was a form of tricking my brain into feeling safe and full but i’m doing better without it. meal prepping instead and keeping food in fridge tht needs to be in fridge…. thank u for the support n it’s possible 2 move forward .!
Advice for snacks,"Hello
I'm a little bit in trouble.. because my brain is totally 'disturbed', i don't achieve to take snacks during the day
Either not hungry or say myself that is not the feeding time..
Do you have any advice to introduce daily snacks ?
I ask it here because I say that i'm in recovery but nothing change because of not enough calorie to gain weight.. even if i'm used to eat 'enormous' amount of food for lunch and donner

Thx"
Should I attempt the 10K calorie challenge?,"I am attempting recovery again after a bit of a relapse. Seriously attempting this time. Ive got a new doctor and will be doing my weigh ins naked weekly so I can’t stuff my clothes like I was before. I even admitted to her I did this. I have an overseas holiday booked for 6 weeks time and I’ve already paid for everything. My parents won’t let me go unless I gain a cartoon amount. I have to take this seriously. 

I’ve always wanted to try the 10K calorie challenge. Should I just do it? 

Maybe it will be negative and make me spiral, but maybe it will be so freeing. I feel like giving myself a challenge to reach 10K will be motivating to actually try. I reckon I can do it. 

On Saturday I got drunk and ate so. Much. Food. For the first time ever I honoured my mental hunger. Being drunk definitely helped. I just couldn’t stop eating. 
The next morning I felt really guilty but also really free. I didn’t wake up with intended weight gain. Yeah, I woke up bloated, but the world didn’t cave in. Now, a few days later, the guilt has faded and I feel more proud of myself 

Thinking of trying the 10K challenge just to eat whatever I  craving and allow myself freedom to prove that food won’t hurt me as much as anorexia will."
how do you start recovery?,"i’ve been restrictive of food nearly all my life but it’s never been as bad as it is right now. i won’t put details so as not to trigger anyone, but let’s just say i’m fatigued all the time and i am in agony. i don’t want to do this to myself anymore. 

so, how did you guys start recovery? ex: did you confide in a family member? doctor? did you go to a rehab/recovery facility? do you have any tips?

thank you in advance :)"
Guys I’m done,"I’m done. I’m done counting calories, I’m done crying at the dinner table. I’m done eating foods I think I like. Muller rice and horlicks? I left inpatient a year ago, I dokt want that shit. I want what I used to eat. I want chocolate buttons and ice cream , I want pizza, I don’t want measured quinoa and prawns. I don’t want it. I either do it now or never. Im training to be a nurse, I couldn’t do those shifts on an empty stomach. I want to eat dinners at uni with my flat mates. I don’t want it to sit on my own eating salad. Im fucking done . This is BULL SHIT. I’ve given myself the worst stomach problems, im miserable because of that. Before I had a sexy body , thighs, a bum, a sick pack from eating like 29 times a day, running around because I wanted too. Free, smiley, happy. Care free. I ate whenever. I didn’t bloat, I had the energy to excersize ebcause it made me feel good. I am . DONE!!! I want to go on holiday and have whatever I want, and not be worried, I want to drink cocktails whenever I want , without restricting. This life is BULL SHIT!!!!!!!!"
Did you know?,90% of anorexics look very fat and always quit right before they get the perfect body they've always wanted
Ate more than planned - not having a great day after,"I had dinner with my sister last night and I ate a lot more than I had intended and planned. I allowed myself to eat what I wanted, and I didn’t pre plan, which was probably what threw me off. 

I ate and drank way more than I usually do and I was so uncomfortable. I’m extremely bloated today and it’s really messing with my body image. I’ve been fighting off the urge to restrict to compensate; I still had breakfast this morning even though my anxiety is really high. 

I thought I was okay, but the stress of last night is getting to me. I feel really awful, and I haven’t been that full in years. I’m trying to remind myself this is a one off since my sister was visiting from out of town. I usually follow my meal plan which has me comfortably full but not uncomfortable. I just haven’t felt that level of discomfort in so long. 

I can’t look at my body without feeling horrible. I’m just hoping the bloating goes away…even my friggin feet are swollen 😭"
urges to gain weight? and Recovery hangover,"Actually, I don't know how to classify this, it may be a question, some kind of vent or I don't know, I'm very confused.

In situations and at times I have genuine and extremely pure urges to gain weight I say ""fuck let's go let's get out of this shit uhrrae!"", And then the next day after eating ""relatively well"" or listening to my EH I feel like shit.lmao

Something like this happens to me with specific triggers like looking at pictures of me from before this nightmare and I'm like ""Boy I had an amazing time that day and I was so happy, and look at me I looked amazing!"", Or with situations like, for example, recently my boyfriend and I went to look for our engagement rings and well, they weren't in my size... They all fell off my finger And honestly... I wish my boyfriend had bought a big ring for me, I don't know, maybe in a way it would be a reminder that ""I had to keep going and maybe that way it would fit me"" I have no idea... It's a genuine emotion that fills me with joy and the next day Boom! Recovery hangover.
It even happens when I talk to some of my friends that I used to practice airsoft with, they just say ""we miss you dude"" or ""we want you back, when are you coming back? :("" And I say... Babe I need my weight back... And the next day hangover.

I hate that feeling of hangover after feeling so motivated... I must say no, the following days I don't restrict or anything like that, but the feeling of ""fuck I shouldn't have done that""  persist.

Me and my hypocrisy in myself... I don't think, it's a vent let me get it out.

One thing I have to clarify is that no, this feeling doesn't trigger binge episodes or anything like that, actually more than anything else it triggers the feeling of happiness at mealtime,And I just feel like I must not have felt good while eating or something like I had no right to enjoy my meal, That."
In what ways can I help my sister recover?,"As a brother, I want to support my younger sister in her current battle against anorexia. Does anyone know (from experience) how I can get her to eat more, without being pushy like some family members?"
How long does it take for boobs to recover?,"22F, I don’t know if I ever had anorexia but about three years ago I began restricting meals a lot then transitioned to vegetarian. Due to noticing a lot of hair thinning and my boobs fully deflating im eating, what I would consider to be, a normal diet but noticing zero change in those areas. I went from a 12 DD to a 10 B. How do I know if they will ever recover or if I have ruined them forever?"
Does exercising affect weight distribution?,"
I've been at a healthy weight for over 4 years now, however my arms, butt and boobs are super small compared to the rest of my body (especially thighs and stomach). I've never stopped exercising during my whole recovery process. I do 30min abs and 20min hiit  4 days a week and on the other days I ride my bike or go for a walk. I know I should be doing more strength training instead of cardio but there's no gym where I live and I also don't really enjoy lifting weights.
Will my weight still redistribute or do I have to change something? Also I haven't had a period for like 10 years and I'm starting to believe I just have to accept that it's not coming back."
How can i fix my metabolism to how it was before? I moss my old metabolism i ruined it,
accidentally saw weight at doctor's office,"im about 1 week into recovery & yesterday was my first meeting with a pcp, because the residential program im trying to get into needed labs & a physical. i got blind weighed and was fine. i have been doing very well avoiding seeing my weight especially as i have been dealing with water retention a LOT due to honoring extreme hunger & knew that seeing whatever numbers there would just make me want to quit recovery, even if it was just water weight.

the nurse handed me my labs paperwork back after making a copy, i saw my weight as it was on the front page & although the jump is still in the single digits i was still very panicked by how much it was (at least in my head). i know logically it isnt all real weight but im just so scared because i already look so much puffier than i did before the water retention hit (which was on wednesday), and im still eating quite a bit. like genuinely a lot, im not overestimating at all. like i genuinely love food so im not really having a hard time actually eating/i dont have many fear foods, just with psyching myself up to do it in the first place, dealing with restrictive behaviors/mindsets, overexercising to earn it. like ill cry making myself a bowl of unweighed cereal, but ill still eat the whole thing. idk. the point is im eating a LOT.

im just fucking scared of how fast im gaining and constantly anxious ever since yesterday while i eat now. like i was fine-ish before knowing my weight, but now that i have that number in my head the disordered thoughts are even louder and louder and i cant even enjoy the food ive been eating today, because all i can think about is the fact that that number is just going up & up & up. idk how to get it to stop, my only solution today was to ask my partner to choose my food today but they've been sleeping constantly (extremely understandable, this past week has been REALLY stressful for the both of us) so im ending up having to be alone & choosing half the shit i eat anyways & its hard to not just choose safe food that i already know the calorie counts of. idk what im even saying at this point im just venting. sorry."
Concerns about logging food,"Over the last few weeks I've noticed stomach pains on par with allergic reactions. At this point, it's probably safe to say that I got into something that I wasn't suppose to. As such, I've been going back and forth of restarting a food log. Thing is, with my long history of being disordered I'm seeing this as a double edge sword. If I track my food and list *only* the ingredients, I can better monitor what might have made me sick. One of my bigger concerns is that with constantly looking at ingredients, that's way too close to calorie information. The last time I did this was to figure out my allergies. Thing is, I'm a little concerned that this might make me relapse... again

Any input/advice would be greatly appreciated"
No hunger and fullness cues,"Hello everyone,
I’m currently dealing with a dilemma that has been stressful for the past 2 years. To summarize, I had an Ed for about a 13 months and I completely lost my hunger and fullness cues. For 2 years I’ve been eating more than enough food; no matter how much I eat, I can’t get full. I’m also 20 year old male for context. There was a period of three months where I was letting go and eating as much as I could. Nothing changed. I’m currently eating three meals and 2 snacks. I’ve gained 100 pounds since and I’m completely lost. I don’t know if I should binge until I’m full to get my cues back, at the expense of being obese or just lost weight to be at a healthier weight regardless of getting back my hunger and fullness cues."
feeling crappy and like i ate too much,"uuurgh, it had been a while since i'd felt guilty about eating ""too much"", but today i do. i didn't eat much more than i would in a normal day, i think - but most of my snacks and even meals were when i wasn't really hungry... 

also, what's really ""snagging"" is the fact that i ate a bit past the moment when the food i was having didn't sound that good anymore - i managed to stop, but I feel like it wasn't ""soon enough"" to be comfortable full?

also, for my morning snack (and tw for food quantities), my mom, sibling and i were at a open mall and i had >! a plum, a nut bar and some chips - a reasonable snack - but then, like, 30 mins later, my brother got a donut and it had been SOO LONG since i'd eaten a donut and I was very mentally hungry for it... but I wasn't physically hungry, but i still got it and shared it with my sister, so i had basically half a donut more than i would in a normal day.!< the thing is, that made me not hungry for lunch, and even though I was hungry for my afternoon snack, since the snack was later in the afternoon, i wasn't really hungry for dinner

anyways, i think ill gain some water weight from today and i hate that - and idk if im more bloated than usual after a day of eating or if im just dysmorphic... anyways, i feel a bit crappy :/

also, ig i'm scared ill ""let that happen again""? like, ill create a habit of overeating even though this doesnt happen often..."
I'm scared,"I've been recovered for a bit over two years. I was doing so well for so long. Now I am 16 months post Partum and I hate my body. I avoid mirrors, I won't dress up in anything because everything feels unflattering. Eating is more and more of a struggle. I'm scared I'm relapsing. I have been stuck at a slightly overweight weight since after my second baby and nothing will let me lose this baby weight. The more I can't lose the baby weight the more I want to be smaller and smaller till I feel like I'm going to dissappear again. I'm scared."
Research study looking for anyone interested in speaking about their experiences (compensation provided),"Hello,

I’m a doctoral researcher at City, University of London and my research involves exploring the relationship between anorexia and a person’s sense of self. My aim is that such research can contribute to improved recovery outcomes through the development of current psychological treatment. 

I am looking for people who meet the following criteria:

* Aged 18 or older
* Native English speaker
* Diagnosed with anorexia nervosa

If you consider yourself as having recovered from anorexia then you are still welcome to participate. Anyone who participates in the study will undertake one interview that should last at least 45 minutes, during which I will ask questions relating to how you have experienced your sense of self throughout your life. This interview would be taking place online.

In appreciation for your time, anyone participating in the study will be compensated with an Amazon voucher worth $20, or the approximate equivalent depending on where you are based.

If you have any questions about the study, or are interested in taking part, then feel free to contact me by private message or my university email: Jackson.Warner@city.ac.uk.

Thank you,

Jackson"
I fucking love food,"I’m like 1.5 years into this recovery hitting a serious stride and honestly I am so unbelievably shocked at myself for ever denying myself food. I love food and I love me. Why would I keep these things apart, me and food?

I’m still dealing with overshoot weight but I don’t even give af. My crazy ass mom and manipulative dad can say whatever they want, I dgaf. 

Food is so good and like also, wowwww what it does for your body… it’s not the enemy, nor is my body. I don’t have to have endless anxiety and insomnia anymore because I eat actual food actually every day. Even when most of the world seemed to not believe me.

If you’re reading this and you are in one of those shitty spots where it’s super hard, dark, lonely, confusing, seemingly impossible, just keep going. For the love of God keep👏🏼effing👏🏼going👏🏼

God bless you all."
"to my 25+ peeps, when did your face start looking younger again ? I feel like I look so old from being underweight",I've gained 10lbs still have a bmi under 15 and i wanna know when will the weight start going to my face?
"How to eat ""normally"" in recovery?","I've been stuck in a binge-restrict cycle for at least half a decade. Since February 2022 or so, I've restricted to the point where I developed gut problems and decided to start recovering (or at least attempting to). Since early 2023, I've dealt with extreme hunger and stopped exercising excessively, which has resulted to me putting on some weight. Unfortunately, this feeling is all too familiar to me and I'm terrified I might be falling back into the binge part of my cycle as I've done so all the times I tried to recover before. I've tried several techniques to attempt to get back into a more ""normal"" manner of eating but I always end up either binging or restricting.

I just want myself back and I really REALLY need advice/support."
fear of taking my meds,"TW for talk of triggering psych medication side effects. PLEASE do not read if this will mess with you. 

Since relapsing a bit in my ED, I’ve been refusing to take my Zoloft because I’m always hearing these horror stories about how SSRIs cause crazy weight gain, mess up your metabolism, make you hungry all the time, etc. Since being unmedicated, my anxiety has been absolutely debilitating and I am suffering so much 24/7, but I’m so scared of the side effects. My dietician and therapist keep pushing me to go back to my psychiatrist and start the meds again, but I don’t want to lose control over my body. Gaining weight unintentionally would trigger me into a really insane relapse, I just know it would. Has anyone had conversations before with a psychiatrist about finding meds without weight-related side effects? I’m slowly moving towards recovery, but I’m just not at a point where I can accept uncontrolled, medication-assisted weight gain. I will not take my Zoloft, but I’m realizing that I do maybe want to try some kind of med again, at least until I can feel more stable and functional with my anxiety."
can anorexia stunt breast growth long term?,
I had Anorexia and didn't know it.,"For years I denied it. Even when it was staring me in the face. I had no idea. I assumed it was my natural body. I was mistreated as a child/neglected and not fed properly. I grew up thinking this was the normal way to eat. I'm an adult now and been suffering since I was young.

I had a revelation one day in March that my spine and ribs shouldn't show. That I shouldn't be eating so little amounts. That being 'small and petite' wasn't a part of 'who I am' as a person, just how I thought of myself as a person.  I thought I was healthy because my bloodwork was normal. I thought I was healthy because I had 'no health effects' even though I have chronic GERD and IBS as a result of my poor nutrition and low body weight. Doctors did not tell me something was wrong with me because all my doctors were overweight themselves and didn't see an issue...They told me to just eat more.. My overweight friends told me they envied my low weight.  I thought it was something good. I thought exercising for too many hours per day was normal and healthy.  I thought only a few calories a day was fine for my body. I did not think I had a problem. .  I find myself worrying about becoming fat even when I didn't know I had that fear. I find myself being fat-phobic and revealing this to myself without knowing I had those feelings.

Anorexia presents differently for different people. For me it was not on purpose, it was a habit as a result of trauma.

I'm finally taking charge of my condition. I stopped some of my more prominent ED behaviors + started eating more. I do weigh myself constantly but my goal is to weigh more, not avoid it. I find myself secretly hoping my figure doesn't change even though I know it has to.

I've gained a few pounds so far in a few months which is groundbreaking for me. I have a long way to go before I am at a 'normal' weight. I'm actually growing a small amount of breast tissue which is encouraging and my spine and ribs aren't showing as much now.I look in the mirror and sometimes feel a bit disgusted by what I consider a 'gut' (which rationally I know is not a 'gut', but my stomach being full of food).  But I know its for the best.

My body is changing and Its bittersweet.

i dont know if i acctually having anorexia,"&#x200B;

as a kid i always was extreamly skinny, but i was getting taller fast, and i was eating double what my siblings eat.when i got to middle school , i was on my current height and i was around 58kgs , i started watching an anime about pop stars ""love live!"" and one of them mentioned smtg about ""having thicc tights, and i looked at mine they were kinda thicc , so i started getting anxious about, maybe i'm fat, i strated less eating , and at the same time, my back started hurting like crazy, i got diagnosed with scoliosis, my mom refused to let me use pain killers, bcz she said this pain is gonna stay for ever, and i better get used to it, else at some point even pain killers wont help, i lost my appetite due to constant pain, by highschool i got diagnosed with anemia, and my mom started shaming me for beeing sick with two things at the same time ,and how im pegging for attetion by ruining my body ,and that it isn't a way to get attetion.

by university ,i move to a big city, and was living on fast food, by that time i got used to the pain, and didnt care much,until few weeks before covid the pain went back hard, and my doctor made me wear a corset, bcz my back got worse after neglecting it.

i lost my appetite later, the corset was hurting my ribs so bad, i couldn't eat, leaugh, barely breath, but no back pain , so i just accepted it, and went to having a meal in 3 days, now i'm off corset, and i'm on the same rythme, my mom always shaming me for my weight, and having no body form , i lowkey like not having curves, bcz i can easly trans into a guy when even i dont feel like beeing a guy.

i want to at least know if i'am anorexic, i dont even know what type of doctor i wanna go to , and when  ever i tell my mom about this , she rage in my face straight, saying that it's not true and it will never be true, so from her reaction i think it's true.

so please guys give me an advice <3"
Advice,"Can anyone give me advice and reassurance I won’t become fat, like I’m working so hard on just being able to eat comfortably but I’m so scared"
Whole body feels bruised?,Is it normal in recovery for your whole body to feel bruised to the touch? like it hurts to sit and everything like it's weird... sorry to keep asking so much stuff😅
Extreme hunger or binge eating,"I feel like my extreme hunger is more like a binge. I suddenly feel really hungry and eat until I am really uncomfortable. Even though I'm physically full I can't stop eating. Afterward, I feel really ashamed and nauseous. But despite that, I continue to overeat almost every day. Going from being really restrictive to losing control over food is really hard. It's like I developed a mindset that either I eat all or nothing. That is why I feel like I suddenly got a binge eating disorder and that it's not just extreme hunger. I am literally so confused and disgusted about myself..."
Body Dysmorphia/Image getting worse,"Does anyone notice their body image getting worse as they recovery? I’ve been weight restored for a while and my body hasn’t changed in a bit but I still notice my body image getting worse. I know I won’t go back to restriction, but I don’t understand why my image of myself keeps getting worse despite making progress in recovery? I definitely don’t like my body or the way I look at all, but I felt that way in the beginning of recovery too so I don’t know why it’s gotten so much worse now. I don’t go out or talk to anyone because I feel so underserving of relationships and love because of the way I look (both romantically and friendship wise). When I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I feel absolutely horrified and my world just shatters. It’s so jarring. I have no idea how to get out of this headspace. I’m in therapy already. I just don’t see my opinion of myself ever changing. How could I ever believe that people would actually love me and care about me? I know people will say that people will love me because of my personality or kindness or whatever, but appearance just feels like everything. People loving me for my appearance feels like real, deep love for some reason. People loving me for my personality but not my appearance doesn’t feel real. I don’t know where this comes from though?"
my hair grew back again,"I noticed a few months ago that I was losing hair and it was starting to get visible, since my body is getting more nutrients, all the hair that was Iost is coming back"
Am I still considered anorexic?,"I didn’t know where else to post this, but can I still be considered anorexic if I’m overweight? I hardly ever eat, I exercise all the time, and all the other stuff about it, but I am obese (can’t lose weight medically). I can’t go to the do for cause they’ll tell me I’m not due to my weight. So would I still be anorexic and be seeking help for it if I’m still fat and overweight?"
I hate going to the bathroom XD,"Like in the words of Doctor Farnsworth, ""Damn these consistent bowels!"" lol like wake up, go to the bathroom. Eat, go to the bathroom.

struggling with weight gain,"i have been in on and off recovery for about a year and i’ve only recently been consistent enough to see significant weight gain. i am well in the middle of the healthy weigh range instead of just teetering on the edge like i was on and off in my early days of recovery. i hit a number on the scale that i swore i’d never go over again. when i was less committed to recovery i still didn’t know what i would do if i hit that number. but im here. i haven’t been weighing myself since i got there because i know it’s do me no good to hyper-fixate but i can’t help it. i know how i feel, and i can physically feel the weight on me. im not used to being this size and every time something happens that reminds me i’ve  gained, i try to be positive. i go from feeling proud and healthy and the next minute im so repulsed by myself and how i feel. it doesn’t help that since i’ve gotten over a lot of fear foods, i haven’t been eating super healthy and i feel guilty about it. i know i shouldn’t, im allowed to eat and enjoy what i eat but im scared that with no more barriers and fears i’ll keep gaining. i know that’s fine as long as i’m healthy but im still scared. how do i reframe this fear? i’ve felt the best i have in a long time but i still have such anxiety over this. any advice?"
hunger and fullness cues missing once again,"I'm on my fourth month of recovery and it's been a couple of weeks (2-3) since my hunger and fullness cues have stopped showing up all that much.

prior to that, my hunger cues had already come back for about a month: i felt hungry. i felt full. it was GREAT. but now my hunger cues are either so subtle or take such a lunch time to come that it's frustrating. 

is it normal for hunger cues to be present and after just not be there at all? i haven't been undereating at all. also, how should i approach eating now? when i don't feel hungry at all, i try to at least eat every 3 hours or so, or whenever a craving hits or when food is offered to me - all these days ive been having at least 3 meals and 2/3 snacks so i'm not worrying too much about that.

but will these cues come back soon? these weeks have been a bit stressful so could that be the reason that's happening? is there anyting i can do to make them come back again other than just wait? :/"
trauma. Potential TW,"f19
I am struggling with my ed bad at the moment, every day is hell and it feels like I’m in a huge relapse. I’m sort of waiting around until Thursday for my MH appointment to see what is going to happen. I’ve been in and out of hospitals but I’m just stuck in this vicious cycle at the moment. I’m just scared.

I have reoccurring nightmares of restraints in hospital for feeds, staff saying things like “we will win, you will lose” as they’re pinning me down, being fed double the amount via tube as punishment for not eating orally. All of these things have traumatised me so much and I feel they hinder any chance of me recovering. This was all in a children’s ward too. I saw and experienced some horrific things I can’t even talk about. Not to mention the early stages of grooming from a male staff member. 

I am underweight and scared to have a meal plan to follow at home because of refeeding but I also want to gain weight/maintain at my own pace. Last time I was in hospital they expected 1.5kg gain per week. I just don’t know what to do, my gp is practically useless as adult services are ridiculous. They don’t want you if you’re “not I’ll enough” but they won’t treat you if you’re “too ill”"
What happens to the body during anorexia? What happens at early stages of recovery?,"Hi, I was wondering what happens to the body during long term anorexia/malnutrition? This is to see what to expect when starting to add more meals in my day.

Something along the lines of metabolism slows down, energy levels decrease, brain lacks nutrition and brain fog occurs, are these correct? What else happens?

Also, what happens when you start to add more meals? Do you initially lose weight due to increase in metabolism? Nutrients start being used up faster due to increased metabolism? Feeling like you have a full stomach, yet hungry at the same time? I'm just guessing here I was wondering if anyone could explain these things to me.

Thanks :)"
fear of relapse,"since march 7 of this yr i have decided to attempt to recover from relapsing summer 2019…. i have structured times of eating and it helps…however every day i am in paralyzing fear that one day something may happen (a trigger , one insensitive comment , online content) that makes me go sick again ….i have lost my period and am getting hand surgery from cutting a nerve while starving myself and trying to cut open a pack of chicken ….. i have reached such lows…some days i miss the pain of being empty and it feels like Stockholm syndrome …."
How to handle social events in a normal/healthy way,"Hi, I’m a 22 F, who has been in a healthy weight for two years after ten hard years of anorexia. 
I have recovered adding foods little by little, until I was no longe afraid of anything. However, I have mantained a healthy weight that I felt comfortable with. 
Ever since I have made more friends and got into a relationship, the social events in my life went up a lot and they always include food and not the healthy kind. So it’s making me a little nervous while it’s also making me gain weight. I think it’s just because I don’t really know how to handle all the events and the food because I have never made it since I was a kid. 
How do you manage these events without feeling bad? Thanks in advance, hope you are all keeping your strength 🤍"
How long were you on Reglan?,"If anyone was prescribed Reglan/metoclopramide for gastroparesis in recovery, how long were you on it?

I started this regimen in hospital in late March, and my outpatient team kept it the same except decreasing it since I keep having frequent stooling. I still struggle with early satiety and gastric motility though, since I'm still constipated despite pooping like 5-10 times a day.

How long is too long to be on Reglan? Did your get weaned off? 

It's worth noting I had mild gastroparesis before I developed AN due to POTS. I had taken Reglan as needed before."
Need advice with recovery,"So last year I went through a 12 month period of very extreme hunger and obviously gained a bunch of weight, infact a lot of overshoot.

The hunger stopped suddenly around January but now I've been feeling like I'm going backwards. My weight hasn't changed much but after getting my periods back last year they did stop again around January also. I was able to get them back by eating a bit more but they're still not normal, very light and end much earlier than normal. I've also been experiencing other symptoms like very slow digestion, bloating, fingers turning blue etc. I normally would have a very fast metabolism and not gain weight easily but now it feels like my metabolism is really slowing down again. I did try to stick to a mealplan again but the biggest problem is that I'm not mentally interested in food anymore, I just feel so tired of eating.  Plus my weight did start going up pretty fast which did freak me out. I cannot deal with anymore weight gain, I'm very much at a breaking point.

I just don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing. I want to heal my body, fix my metabolism and lose the excess weight so I can finally get on with my life but I feel absolutely stuck in this situation. I'm doing very bad mentally, especially because of the weight, and have even considered ending things.

So what in the hell can I do to achieve full recovery?"
Progress,"5-6 months ago, I was 75-79 lbs at 5'7"", heart palpitations, anxiety attacks, collapsing on the sidewalk, brain fog 24/7.

Now - 5'8"", 113 lbs, benching 8-10 reps w/ 90 (which still isn't a lot, but given the time frame, it's something). Still running, still lifting, getting stronger.

Worth it? Still deciding, but definitely not going back.

Truth be told, I miss being skeletal/emaciated; systematic/progressive hypertrophy feels unnatural - interestingly enough, self-starvation at this point I consider to be my ""natural"" state as in, I'll  gravitate towards fasting and overexertion (cardio) subconsciously as opposed to, say, consciously restricting. Maybe I'm psychologically and physically traumatized/impaired to that extent (even before my eating disorder, I was extremely hyperactive and scrawny for my age). Ironically, the whole ""body image""/""fitness industry"" is what's actually keeping me in a (hopefully) permanent remission - that, and the fact that - well, it's a lot harder to hurt someone when they're physically stronger than you are (and I'm not letting that happen to me again).

will my heart heal?,Will my heart ever get better?  is this permanent? should I just go ahead and try to get disabilty benefits? any recommendations on food specifically that will be best for recovery?
First day of treatment,"Today I had my first day of treatment. The team is working to get me to baseline, so I had to eat past fullness all day long. I am so tired and feel gross. I really want to skip dinner, and I was so uncomfortable I don’t even want to go back. It’s a good program, I’m just having a hard time being so full :/ my dietitian told me I can just focus on dinner tonight and I don’t have to do an evening snack, but dang how quickly I’m forgetting all the reasons I’ve chosen recovery :( 
Pls people who have been here tell me how things progressed for you and how this stage didn’t last forever"
Did I just suddenly lose three weeks of food/water weight?,So I've been in recovery four about 3-4 weeks now and have gained weight in the double digits. I weigh myself every other day and consume close to the recommended calorie limit daily and so far I've been staying within the same 3-4lb range since going into recovery. I understand starting off my digestive system will act weird since it no longer knows how to process larger quantities of food and some bloating will occur for a few weeks going in. I weighed myself yesterday and I was UNDER my SW and I am just...so confused right now. I stepped off and got back on multiple times and the number stayed the same. Has this happened to anyone before?
tw- is the pain of recovery worth it?,"i’ve struggled with body image and food for most of my life but around january and in the past 3 months is when it’s gotten extreme, i lost a lot of weight really quickly and to put it shortly- every thought was  and is abt my body and food. i have doctors appointments weekly and have ended up in hospital a few times because of what i have done to my body- the mental health professionals and my family think that i just lost my appetite and that i didn’t do it on purpose. as much as i hate to say it i am faking recovery to an extent because i still know that i am not eating enough even tho it is more than what i was. i cannot shake the thoughts, i feel that now i am diagnosed with anorexia my disordered habits are all i am and idk if i can ever unlearn them i don’t have to tell y’all how miserable it is- i think u all know. i want my period back, i want my life back, i want to repair my body but i cannot face the reality that i’d have to tell my psychologist that i did it on purpose and that i need help to actually be able to recover because i know then that i’d have to do so much more work and it would break my mums heart to know how bad it truely is - and it almost kills me to even think about weight gain. i’ve made a pros and cons list but i need someone to tell me wether it will all be worth it or not because right now i really have no one i can tell since i’ve kept it secret to everyone but my bf who knows the tiniest bits about it ."
Advice Please,"Hello, I am 30 years old and started recovery for anorexia at age 16. I

Terminology Question,
cant accept weight gain in recovery,"i have been struggling with a diet mentality for years but i was just deep in my eating disorder these past months. I was anorexic for a 4-5 months but it greatly impact me since i love food and was never underweight from the start. Now i’m currently in recovery (all-in) for 2-3 months and i RAPIDLY gain weight. I feel like i’ve gained all or even more weight than before i start being in the diet mentality which was years ago when i was constantly getting bullied. Right now i can literally feel it in my bones that im bigger than ever and it literally made me so uncomfortable. I know i couldn’t go back to restricting anymore because after going all-in food is just too good. I’m so scared this weight gain wouldn’t stop and will lead me down to the binge eating side. Am i doing the right thing satisfying my cravings? Or am i just binge eating? sometimes i feel like a piece of shit since i’ve stopped exercising for a while now. When i was deep in my ed, i used to rigorously exercise everyday. Right now i just feel like a total crap, so im not sure that recovering like im doing right now is correct or not"
Pain,is it normal to hurt this much? my arms feel like I've done 500 inverted pushups and pull ups😣
Water intake,"(This might be a bit of a weird question, I’ll try to phrase it as best as I can)


So, I’ve heard from various places that the recommended daily water intake is 1.5-2L. However, when I drink that much, I constantly feel very full which makes it harder to eat and it leaves me with painful bloating. And that takes very long to go away.So…


Do you guys think it’s ok to cut back on water in early recovery? I don’t want this to turn in a disordered behaviour and I’m not looking to harm my body either. OR, should I push through and hope it gets easier?"
I did it...,"I smashed the scale with a hammer, it's gone. And I quit my physically demanding job that fed into my issues(not that I could even do the job anymore after I almost collapsed the other day...) idk what I'm doing but I'm living and I'm choosing life over this disorder. Thank you all. Thank you so so much...❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
How late is too late to recover from stunted growth due to anorexia?,I’m don’t have anorexia like where I want to make myself skinny it’s from stress and weed addiction and stuff but I can’t get off it cuz it makes me not able to eat and sleep at all I just hallucinate lol but it all started when I was like 12 probably and now I’m 16 still dealing with it I’m 5”1 and 32kgs
I'm tired of my body looking sick and I want to stop feeling like I'm missing out on life,"I've been in recovery since February and I've gained a bit but not much because I've been so scared to change and gain weight. But now that it's May and the weather's a lot nicer I've been wearing shorts and shirts instead of baggy pants and sweaters and realizing how ugly I think I look. One of the few things I liked about myself before restricting and losing a lot of weight were my thighs, but now they look like a pair of toothpicks just as thick as my calves/lower legs and my knees look knobbly and twisted without any fat covering some parts of it. I don't want to wear shorts or skirts because I think I look so disproportionate and sick in them and I just want to go back to the way I used to look before all of this when I thought my body was perfectly fine and was happy. 

At the same time I'm so scared to make any change, like this morning I thought maybe I'd have a second breakfast or make my portion larger so I didn't end up eating a whole bunch before bed to make up for the restricting I still do throughout the day, but I couldn't do it. I still count calories to see how I'm doing, but I'm scared of calories early in the day out of the chance that I might end up eating a whole bunch later on. My mom wants me to get my period back and that is genuinely the scariest thing I think could happen to me. She's made it clear that the things I'm allowed to do are very restricted until she thinks I'm healthy enough to do them, which is probably a good decision but it still sucks. I'm not allowed to get a job, I'm barely allowed to do anything involving exercise, and I feel like I'm watching a huge part of being a teenager go by without participating all because of my stupid decision last summer to ""become more healthy"". 

I think I want to recover, there seems to be a lot of pros to it, y'know? I'm still just so so scared. Every time I accidentally look in the mirror and see my stomach looking rounder and softer I get scared and want to relapse, I'm way too scared to stop exercising in secret, and I can't even put butter on sandwiches without breaking down crying. I've been seeing a psychologist but I don't hold any high opinions of her, she's kinda useless and the only person that helps me recover is my mom. I don't know what to do, I'm torn and even though I want the old me back change is so terrifying. 

I don't know why I'm posting this or what kind of comments to expect, I guess this is just a vent/rant that I've needed to get out for a while. If this is too specific and goes against the rules I'm super sorry I don't want to do any harm, I think I just need to be able to say this without the consequences of telling someone I know."
How to deal with learning my weight after a year of restriction?,"I noticed my weight was influencing my daily life about a year ago and ever since then my boyfriend has kept an eye on my weight. Even though ive lost quite a lot over the last few months and have been diagnosed with atypical anorexia ive been able to avoid knowing the exact number to try and protect myself.

My fear is that when I know my weight that it will trigger me to try and stay below it even though Ive been doing well in recovery. My treatment team advises that I should face it and learn to deal with it but I have no idea how to do this. Do I wait untill Im at my old, healthy weight (the last one I saw myself) or do I start now? What if it is not “low enough” and I relapse? 

Any advises or experiences?"
extreme hunger after a short lapse?,i just had a short (~3 week) lapse/relapse (my intake was on the higher end) and now i feel like i’m experiencing extreme hunger like i did after recovering the first time. is this normal or is there something wrong? i don’t need to weight restore or anything so i’m sort of anxious about how my calorie intake is going to affect things
I GOT MY PERIOD BACK !!,"after 2 yrs of no period, i got it back through just 3.5 months of lots of food and no exercise!! i thought it wld take me so much longer but it didnt. dont lose hope!!! :)))))"
TW-I want help,I can't keep doing this... I can't... It's going to actually kill me. But recovering will kill me. I don't want to gain weight. I weighed myself and got mad and broke my scale cause I gained 5lbs in one day somehow when I've not really ate much of anything😭(edit: I got it working again😥) I can hardly walk. my legs keep giving out. I keep having accidents. my heart hurts... I'm so tired and cold and irritable and I can't think straight... I hate myself for being this way😥 I want to recover but gaining weight is making me suicidal... I just want to stay small😭 I'm sorry if I don't make it... I'm so sorry... I'm trying😭
How do your loved ones support you?,"Hi,

I'm in the recovery process and doing it willing this time. I've hit rock bottom and realize that I want to recover. While I find my family wants to support me, I feel like some things are not very helpful. I have a sibling who is apathetic towards whether I eat or not most of the time. I rarely see or communicate with them, depsite iving  in the same house. They offered to take me out for a meal and suddenly cared about what and how much I would eat for that meal. I politely turned down their offer and they became upset. They have told me that I need to be more indpendent, so I don't understand why they became frustrated. It's very confusing...

Also, right now it feels a bit overwhleming and I drastically restrict before or after the meal due the stress. If I'm pushed to have one large meal, I just spiral down into a deficit...They just seem convinced that this will ""even"" out my caloric intake. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong for turning down their offer?"
Brain damage,"Hi
I was thinking about takimi cerebrolisyn. To help my brain be recovered. What do you think?"
not gaining weight in recovery? very frustrated! I want to gain,"my weight is morbidly underweight and I've been trying to recover for a year now and my weight isn't budging at all, stuck at the same weight. I'm eating 4 times the amount I was maintaining at yet I'm still only maintaining. has this happened to anyone else??? will the weight eventually start to come like is my body just still getting used to eating? I have to recover on my own because no insurance. I've only started like very seriousy making sure I /for sure/ eat enough to gain the past 2 weeks but still even in 2 weeks no gains at all yet I thought i'd be gaining at least 1-2lbs a week , I;m eating so much I spend all day eating and my stomach hurts with how much I eat idk if I can get myself to eat more :/ but when I calculate how much i need to gain I'm eating that much (1.5-2.5k) but I hear a lot of people in recovery needing to eat more then they typically would if it were a normal gaining weight situation? But I don't feel hungry at all, still no appetite, my stomach hurts so bad after 1-2 bites, I'm literally like gagging on the food but trying to make myself eat anyway every meal pretty much but I have been successfully finishing my meals which I'm proud of but it's dissapointing to see my efforts aren't paying off when I've been trying so hard everyday :("
Stomach pain,Why after eat I feel stomach pain instead of fullness and satiety? When it will end?
i want a genuine opinion,"i’m on vacation and i’m allowing myself to eat more than us usual. but i want a genuine opinion on wether or not i’m eating way too much or not because it feels like it but i honestly can’t tell :(

>!yesterday my mom and i went out for brunch. i ate a seafood platter with a lobster tail, four pieces of shrimp, an oyster, and some hamachi. we shared brussels sprouts and an edamame hummus salad. 
later we went to a famous bakery called Lysee and I ate their chocolate cake. My mom and I also shared the bakery’s yuja tea and…. three different kinds of these loaf-shaped mini cakes (i felt really guilty afterwards) 
Later my mom and I shared an almond milk matcha latte and then for dinner I ate half a (huge) bowl of beef pho. I also ate some of my mom’s lobster pad thai.!<

Am I eating too much? I’m around 157cm. We walked a lot because we’re in New York but I still felt really disgusted with myself :( please be brutally honest."
Body gave out - TW?,"I freaked out and relapsed, and started doing things I shouldn't be doing and then I have a very physically demanding job that just honestly feeds my ED if that makes sense and basically I almost collapsed at work and broke down crying and had to go home and my heart feels like it's going to give out and my body is beyond exhausted and I can hardly walk and stuff and now idk that I can go back to work... If I could slow down and stop my bad habits and beat this I could probably be okay going back to work, but it's kinda hard when you work a physical job outside in the miserable heat and if you don't eat and drink a stupid amount you'll lose weight and then if you eat too much you'll get sick from the work/heat but also if I don't eat the way I am I can't function... ugh... idk what to do I don't think I can go back to work..."
my doctor wants me to keep gaining weight,"it took me so long to accept the weight that the doctors want me restore at but recently i went back to the doctors and they said it has to be 5 lbs higher than what they previously told me. im so annoyed and angry and i just really dont wanna be that weight. im a healthy weight and i finally feel confident in my body but i feel like thats all just gonna go away. and they're telling me i have to keep eating a meal plan until i get my period back but i dont think ill be getting my period anytime soon so if i keep eating my meal plan while waiting for my period to come, ill just become overweight. i just hate this all and i hate my doctor for lying to me, im just really feel faking the weight gain when i go to the doctors again."
what worked best for your recovery?,"im currently really struggling with my ed, and i think that if i dont try and get better soon i am in some real health trouble. ive recently started noticing my hair thin out, im still not happy with myself, and people are starting to get really worried about me. i do want to get better, but i dont really know where to start. i have a good therapist but she isnt too experienced with eating disorders which sucks because thats the main thing im struggling with right now, ive considered looking around for inpatient programs but i have heard awful things about those places. i dont even know how to bring it up to the people i care about because i dont want them to make it a big deal, but it is a big deal. ive almost completely lost all hunger cues, and i can only manage to have a couple bites of something before i feel sickly full. any advice would be very much appreciated <3"
Struggling to stay recovered,"Hi guys, so I've been recovered from anorexia for about a year now but lately I've been feeling like a relapse is around the corner.

Sandwiches,"I am in my sandwich era. I am talking lovely sandwiches with good quality deli meat, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, condiments, fresh bread -the works. I was missing out for YEARS. WHY THE HECK WAS I SO AFRAID OF THESE TOTALLY MANAGEABLE AND SATISFYING MEALS??!! 

This is the first time in over a decade where I finally learned what comfortably full and satisfied actually means…and I didn’t need to binge and purge. Like…I feel okay with my meal for the first time in years. I could cry. 

I friggin love sandwiches!!"
Birthday activities during recovery,"I'm not sure if this would be more appropriate to ask on r/AnorexiaNervosa, since I'm not familiar with that subreddit (not sure if a lot of people are pro-ana there or not), so I assumed it might be safer to ask here.

My birthday is coming up so I've been thinking about what to do for it. My friend is currently battling anorexia, so I was wondering what some good activities would be / what activities I should avoid. She has a dietitian and therapist if that's a factor at all.

Thank you!"
Struggle meal recipe!,"Hi there, this is my first post on this sub. I began recovering in February, and it’s been very up and down, but today I had a win. I have been feeling so tired lately and I struggle cooking because of it. I used to/still have an aversion to cooking things that aren’t intricate, but because I’ve been struggling to cook I’ve been more firm with myself to get it done. 
Two weeks ago I was sick (due to a food allergy) and boiled noodles, tossed them in olive oil and salt. Since then I’ve cooked it twice and added an Italian seasoning blend and black & red pepper. Honestly it hits, but more importantly for me is sooooo low effort! I wanted to share for anyone who needs a low effort recipe, I’m planning to keep the ingredients on hand for when I need it and add some parm!"
Hair Loss,"Hi everyone. I’m a few months into recovery and I’m still noticing hair loss. I don’t have any bald patches but I’ve lost a ton of volume, my hairline’s receded a little and my hair is very brittle. 

I’m making sure I’m getting plenty of fat in my diet but it’s very discouraging that I’m not seeing any improvement :( how long do you think before I’ll start to see any changes?"
How to stop wanting to ask this very inappropriate question,"I’ve been in anorexia recovery for about 8 years now. I’ve had better and worse times, however I’d say I’m in an overall decent place right now. I’ve gained a bit of unintended weight and im really struggling to not constantly body check and think about it. For some reason, this specific thing has been an ongoing issue that I’ve never shaken: really wanting reassurance from other people. And not just my bf/family as the ED side of me believes that they will say anything to keep me happy/healthy. The ED person in me wants to go around asking people “hey am I fat?” “Am I still attractive and skinny?” but of course I’d never/have never done that as it’d be wildly inappropriate. Is there something that y’all can relate to in this or something that y’all have used to bypass this? I’m sorry if this is really inappropriate but I’ve frankly run out of ideas.

Edit: I have also started to do strength training for the better half of a year now, and I’ve been mainly focusing on legs and burning belly fat, which is making me even more aware of my body."
Protein shakes,"Hello there 🫶🏼 

Was wondering if any of you have tried protein shakes for weight gain and if they worked for you? My doctor and therapist recommended I try one, but they didn’t give me any recommendations. If any of you have had any recommendations or one that worked really well for you, I’d appreciate any info at all! 
Thank you 🩵🫶🏼"
Trouble eating when not craving something,"So I’m stuck in this quasi-recovery phase where I’m perfectly fine eating any food I want because I tell myself I’m listening to my body and giving it what it needs. However, when I’m hungry, but not necessarily craving anything or wanting anything specific, I have absolutely no idea what to do. It’s hard to get myself to eat in these situations because it feels so wrong, and I have no idea what my body needs when it’s not giving me any specific signals. For example, the other day I was hungry around dinner time but I didn’t have too much food in my apartment and didn’t feel like going to get some more in the moment. I had pancake batter though so I decided to make pancakes for dinner. I wasn’t craving pancakes in the slightest but it was all I really had and I obviously knew I needed to eat. I got myself to eat most of it, but it was such a battle because the whole time I was like “my body doesn’t even want this.” I guess instead of obsessing about weight or calories, I’m now obsessing about following my cravings perfectly, which is of course not practical. Sometimes we have to eat what we might not necessarily want because we simple don’t have another choice at the time. I’m not sure how to overcome this hurdle this time though? When I don’t have cravings, I find it hard to eat “healthy” food because I’m scared I’m giving into the ED, but I also find it hard to eat “unhealthy” food because then it feels like I’m eating it just to prove a point, which doesn’t feel right either. How do I decide what to eat when I’m not craving anything?"
TW- relapse,"Idk what to say but don't read if you don't want to and I'm sorry😞

Anorexia and fertility,"I think I’ve met the love of my life, and we’ve been talking a bit about children.

Hypermetabolism,Does everyone in recovery get it?  Do different methods of recovery affect your chances of getting hypermetabolism?
Back to normal?,Was one of your ana symptoms or disadvantages boob size shrinkage. Originally I liked getting smaller boobs when I started my fitness journey but I get tired of them. Because Covid I went back up to my before fitness journey number and they were still small. Then I weight back to down to my normal healthy weight and still nothing. I like that their not huge but seriously when I lay down their not even there. Any recommendations.
What I am doing wrong?????,"How am I different from other patients? From those who recovered? Recently I see people with whom I wrote or even visited the center a few years ago. And they came out of it. Physically - what you can see and mentally. The other part ... died 🙄

What's different about me? Why can't I get out of this shit? Why do I.  feel so bad about myself? What am I doing wrong? I am so tired  and  lonely. I don't know where to look for answers. So what if I understand the mechanism of anorexia. Nothing. I can't concentrate anyway, I'm weak, I don't sleep, I don't realize my dreams. I am a vegetative human form. I have no strength for anything. I want to do nothing. I force myself into everything I do. Because you have to. Because you have to get up. And so for several years. I am on treatment, I take my pills... I have been sick for the 3/4 my life."

How did you get over the idea of never being sick enough?,This is the number one thing holding me back. I always end up relapsing because I never feel like I’ve gone “far enough” in the illness. I really want to move on and recover but I can’t let go of this thought.
Struggling to not relapse,"My life sucks and my """"perfect body"" was all I really had going for me and I'm struggling with the weight gain now cause the way it's making my body feel and I'm falling into a really dark place and I'm really really struggling.

is it ok to weigh myself or not?,"i kind of want to weigh myself. it's been over two months since i've last weighed myself and my body is quite different, but i'm also insecure that maybe i haven't restored my weight at all. maybe I haven't gained enough for my body to recover. idk, I just feel like I should weigh myself to make sure i'm gaining weight as i should in recovery - but will that do me more harm than good? 

are those just excuses my illness is using to finally be able to look at the scale - and then proceed to make me feel bad about it?

there are also some important-ish reasons to why i should know my weight - taking medications for example. the headache/general pains medication i usually take bases the ammount of mL you have to drink on your age and weight, and not knowing it makes it sort of imprecise.

i'm also conflicted about what would be better to my recovery - knowing my weight, facing it head on and accepting it, or just now knowing and not caring what it is?

i just don't want to possibly trigger myself with it"
closer to weight restoration but scared to eat now,im like 5 lbs away from weight restoration and im rlly scared bc i dont like eating anymore... i really am scared to eat bc i feel like if i eat like 3 meals a day and snacks like i usually do ill just keep gaining beyond my weight goals. im having so much trouble getting through my meals and i feel rlly lonely bc my parents arent supporting me through meals anymore (they never rlly did but they especially dont now) bc they just expect me to eat it and think im fine now bc ive been completing my meal plan majority of the time now. i feel alone and idk what to do
attention,does anyone else feel like they can only do well in recovery if they have attention and people caring? like i never talk to my friends abt my ed but i feel like i need to have my family always there and sometimes im scared to be recovered bc im scared they wont care abt how i am anymore... idk why im like this and i feel embarrassed abt this bc it further perpetuates that stereotype that all anorexics/bulimics are attention seekers :(
Does your diagnosis change from Anorexia to Atypical anorexia when you gain weight?,"My first official diagnosis was atypical, I lost more weight and they changed it to “just” anorexia.

How do I help a friend who’s showing early signs?,"TW just in case: One of my close friends is constantly being body shamed by her mother even though she is average size for her height. She refuses to eat more than a few cherry tomatoes at lunch time and feels guilty when she doesn’t eat healthy or eats too much and she weighs herself a lot. She’s not purging or completely starving yet but I really want to support her and help her out of the spiral before she goes too deep. Some of her other friends have come to me and said they were also worried, I show her love and tell her that her mom is saying nonsense which she knows but ofc it’s not easy to just ignore the comments. I’m especially worried because she’s going to spend her whole summer with her mom. So yh if any of you have any tips to give me on how to be an even. Better friend to her I’m more than happy to listen.

How does one stop assigning food value?,"Even though I’m letting myself eat the food I deem “bad” and try to be neutral to them, I can’t stop separating them from other foods. 
They’re either “not a proper meal” or “unhealthy” or I use them as a scapegoat when I feel unwell.


How do I rewire my brain to not think of one food as “bad” and another as “good”? 

I know by holding on to this mindset I’m slowing down my recovery, and I really want to change that! 

Any tips or recourses are greatly appreciated <3"
gaining weight,"i’ve been struggling with anorexia for the past few years. i’ve been in recovery for a bit now, trying to eat bigger meals throughout the day (in every meal). now though, i’ve noticed that i eat a LOT of snacks at night. after dinner, when i’m not even necessarily hungry, i’ll go back to the kitchen and eat bags of chips, chocolate, muffins, etc. why is this??? i understand extreme hunger is common in recovery, but why does it hit me so hard at night? i almost blank out when i’m eating too. is this extreme hunger or is it leading to bed? i’m also starting to gain weight and i notice it in my stomach. would working out help build muscle to help balance out this rapid weight gain? someone please help"
heart rate over 150 after recovery and feeling physically weak,"does anyone have heart palpitations?Not sure if that's actually what you call them-- when you can feel your heart skipping beats, stumbling, beating irregularly? It just kind of flops around like a fish for a minute trying to get its shit together. It's weird.
i’ve had ed for more than a decade now, at my lw i had a really low heart rate, and that was very common for anyone with ed. never scared me really. now i’ve been in and out of recovery for the last two years, i restored my weight, but my heart rate now is 100-170 throughout the whole day, im not exercising nor doing anything active, i could be staying in bed and my heart will start palpitating. i get very nauseous too.
i don’t see ppl with ed talk about high heart rate, only low one, so i’m not sure what is happening. 
could it be that over the years i was in the cycle of recovery and restricting again and again, i made my heart muscles weak and im getting closer to having a heart attack??? cause for 5years i was at thw same low weight, no gaining or losing, so my body adapted to that over the years, but when i got into a cycle of gaining and losing around 10kgs really fast, my body could not adapt and all the muscles became weaker?
im recovered with restored weight, but i feel so much worse and weaker physically."
Struggling with calorically dense foods,"I have started all in recovery, I am on day 10 since I started. I have been dealing with eating disorders for 3 years now. In this time span I have made 3 attempts at recovery and have relapsed each time. This being my fourth, I want to ensure it’s my last. I think that this might be why I am overthinking things but let me try to paint y’all a picture, so that maybe you can give me feedback on what to do. So my issue right now is adding the more caloric dense options of foods I am use to eating. For instance I would always eat the oikos triple zero yogurt which is 90kcals. I now feel like since I am in all in recovery I should be getting the most caloric yogurt option made with whole fat milk. This wouldn’t be much of an issue if I didn’t have an insane (trust my stomach Is an endless black hole) stomach capacity. I would literally eat pounds of yogurt! Since it was lowcal I would kind of not sweat it too much. I am scared shitless every time I eat yogurt because I don’t trust myself eating the high cal yogurts. I am constantly on edge trying to eat super slowly and make sure I am enjoying the food as much as I can. On top of this I am always on the lookout for how fast I am eating, and trying not to loose control and stuff my face. How can I get around this I am seriously really frustrated. I seriously ppl who simply eat one yogurt and move on with their lives while I am over here eating entire 2 lbs tubs like nothing 🫠"
Get muscle for recovery ?,"Hi, 
I'm seeing my body changing, get more belly
Then I would like to know if I should go to do some strenght exercice or wait to get a normal BMI...
I'm a male and it seems that i'm a skinny fat guy now 😭
This f****** illness ate my muscles..
Any one get suggestion from a doctor ?"
is this normal in recovery?,"Started recovering and admittedly definitely eating too much but aside from that, my whole body hurts so bad... And I'm passing a lot of undigested food... like, I know I'm eating a lot but that's kinda scary..."
Best resources for recovery?,"My new partner’s daughter is suffering from AN, what are the best resources for me to learn how to help her recover - things to help her with acceptance, motivation and persistence around recovering? TIA."
is this disordered or restrictive?,"yesterday i downloaded an app which checks the nutrition on products, but instead of showing calories and etc, it's more like the aditives it has, wether it's high in sugar or not, saturated fats and etc.

it doesn't label foods as ""bad"" or ""good"", but (and i hate to admit it to myself) i've been thinking about the ""ratings"" it gave to a lot of foods i scanned. one of my favorite yoghurts got a 4,8/10 ""rating"", and i actually haven't thought much about it - i still think i'll have it with the same frequency; whenever I crave.

but i am a bit worried i might start obsessing over these ratings and stopping listening to my cravings as often? idk, I realized that now i'm a bit worried of what rating the granola i eat every day might get. would i stop eating it as often if it gets a low rating? i'm more worried about how I might react in the future with these informations and wether they'll hinder my progress in recovery than how i feel about them now.

so is it restrictive? diet-culture induced? disordered? or just a good way to take better care of my health?"
Did your circulation ever improve?,"I'm gaining weight but I'm still having circulation problems. It's hot outside now but my feet are still freezing despite wearing multiple socks and moccasins. I suffer from Raynaud's too. 

My question to those who have recovered is: Did you notice any improvement in your circulation after recovering, and if yes, at what point in the recovery process did you begin to notice it?

I understand that damage done by EDs can take a long time to heal, I'm just looking for some reassurance that this will get better. I find the cold to be extremely debilitating."
Canned Vegetables,"I'm doing better than I ever have all thanks to some canned corn (and other vegetables but mostly corn)

It's been really helpful guilt free eating for me and mixing in a small bit of butter and even just salt and pepper makes your tastebuds so happy.

It's helped me so much getting healthy and I wanted to share because I never even thought about them before"
how?,"so i associate running with being deep in my ED, how do i un-associate it? like i’m recovered physically and struggle a bit with mentally but much better and want to be able to change how i think about running and exercise to be able to do it again healthily."
I don’t mind being full anymore!,I’m actually starting to like the feeling of being full. I also have so much more energy and better mood :D
I need a recovery high man,"Ok so I have anorexia. I am in the very early stages of recovery like I'm just a couple days. I am also the type of person who will pretty much only do things if I feel like somebody's relying on me to do it. My problem is I don't have anybody to be my ""cheerleader"" right now. Most people in my life I don't feel safe telling them  I'm in recovery. And the other people who would be my ""cheerleaders"" in situations Iike this have recently turned against me due to a very nasty breakup. I just don't know what to do. I need advice on how to gain a hype man. The doctors are amazing. Don't get me wrong, but I need somebody who I have a personal connection with outside of the medical facility."
Yellow skin??,"Because of my eating habits, I lost my boobs and butt, and my skin has developed a yellowish hue, I’m eating back to normal but it isn’t going away. Have I ruined my looks forever? :("
Breakthrough,"So I had an episode the other day and after some crying and stuff I got over it and just gave it and just kept eating and eating and got a bit upset about it but pushed through and just kept eating and gained a few pounds and noticed this morning my face wasn't as sunken in and I lost it and brokedown crying tears of joy because my face didn't look so bad, and even though I'd gained a few pounds, I LOOK BETTER NOW😭 I've fought this for over two years now and I finally feel good about gaining weight and want to keep gaining I feel better physically I look better, I have energy... I'm so happy I keep breaking down crying😅 Thank you all that have given me words of encouragement and advice and support I love you all and I hope everyone in here can reach this point and recover fully and I also hope I don't ever go back I don't want to ever go back😅❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
My sister needs help,"I want to approach her in a way of love and understanding. She is a very literal person and needs facts. According to the BMI chart, shes only slightly under norm. How can I show her how inaccurate the BMI chart is? I'm very worried and so is our mom"
diet coke??,is diet coke bad for you??? it’s all i drink and i hear it’s bad for you and it can cause weight gain??? is this true? :(
"(DAE?) I still feel like there's a ""switch"" in my head every time I'm triggered","I'm two years recovered, weight restored and overall doing a lot better. But I still get triggered from time to time, and it's like my whole thought process changes SO FAST, like a switch. My thought process, my feelings, even my personality. I become so robotic and angry and all I have in my head is disordered thoughts. It doesn't usually last for long, I try to ground myself and not relapse and I'm doing good. But it's sooo freaky when this happens, it's like I'm a completely different person and I don't recognise myself.

Does anyone else experience this?? It's so scary to think that I can go back to the worst time of my life in literally a second. Wondering if I'm the only one."
apple,"today i felt hungry after school so i just picked up an apple and bit into it, hardly thinking abt it. cant remember the last time i did that :)"
I’m just tired,"Possible trigger warning?

I’m tired of food and eating. That my head has given food such a glorified status. By restricting and refusing me food, my ED told me that it was something more than nourishment.

I’m tired of food always having to have meaning. Today I ate pancakes for the first time in who knows how long, I’ve actively wanted pancakes since November, and though I don’t want to admit it, was *really* looking forward to it. But it didn’t taste like anything special. It wasn’t what I had imagined. I’ve been refusing myself something I’ve wanted for half a year, hated myself for even having the thought of eating and wanting it. And then it was just disappointing. Why can’t I just do like a normal person and accept this meal was meh and then move on? 

I’m so darn tired that when I eat it must always be something I want, something I crave, and then I must enjoy it, or it wasn’t worth it.

I’m tired of obsessing over food, almost always thinking about it. Planning meals, fantasising about what I can eat. Noticing what other people eat, watching cooking shows, looking at recipes. I wish food didn’t claim such space in my head.
I’m so done with eating and recovery. And I hate how the only way I can fix this is by thinking about food, by eating food (meal plans, making sure I eat enough, challenging fear food etc.). I wish food didn’t have to be the solution. I wish I dind’t have extreme huger and that I eat all the freaking time. And how I keep craving the things my ED don’t want me to eat. 

I’m tired of how eating causes so many fights and disagreements in my head. I just want to be left alone, honestly.

I’m also tired by how food is portrayed in society. When you meet people it’s almost always over lunch or dinner, when enjoying yourself you always have a treat. It’s as if food is required to have a good time. That food is *so* beyond just nourishing the mind and the body. And then we’re told that we always have to be careful how much we eat and what we eat. That food is bad? At least certain foods. Food shouldn’t have values, it doesn’t serve anyone (except EDs). 

I honestly really wish I could stop eating again, but I know I cant, not if i want to have an actual life, experience stuff, have friends, do the stuff I want. 

But I’m just so tired of how food has so much meaning. I mean, cant food, for goodness sake, just be food?"
how can i support my (mostly) recovered fiancée through a trigger?,we went shopping today and there was a dress in a size that normally fits her (if anything it sometimes ends up too big). I encouraged her to try it on and it wouldn’t button anywhere. she hasn’t gained any weight recently (not that it matters but just shows it’s fully the brand running super small causing it not to fit). she doesn’t want to eat dinner now and has been super upset since. it really got to her and i haven’t seen anything trigger her this bad. how can i help her?
Loose skin??,"I have lost a pretty big amount of weight but never had loose skin but after i started recovery [plus fat redusposition because of testosterone injection for gender affirming care] made me get this wobbly skin on my tummy. I suspect that it's loose skin because i didn't gain any weight and it feel kinda empty and just wobbles around even when i breath it. 

It's like gigantic insecurity now and i feel so fat because of it and kinda want tips against it or anything tbh???"
how,how am i able to go on walks without becoming obsessed with it? without being completely consumed by it? without being compulsive? i used to walk in my eating disorder so i don’t know… should i do something else? or how do i change my thoughts around it?
Why are my friend’s stomach’s flat but mine isn’t?,"I have been in recovery in for 6 months, and my stomach just looks big. I get really bloated, but even when im not, it doesn’t look flat. Will it be like that forever?"
18 male and I need help,"For years I have been dealing with anorexia, when I was young it was just me being underweight, but since quarantine for 3 years, I have been stuck at a very low weight. I am six foot but my weight is very bad. I often look in the mirror, sometimes I feel good because my shoulders are broad but then I remember I am very unwell and the bones are very visible. I was bulking for 2 weeks and put on 6 pounds. But I still find myself on my computer just rotting away and losing all my weight again back to anorexic levels. The doctor said if i don't do the weight back myself, they will put a hole in my stomach and force feed me. I really do not want to do that, how do I get back to a healthy or a little underweight weight because I do not want to bulk , eat a lot and lose it fast again, how do I keep the weight, do I just keep on going on going?"
i genuienly don't know how to live without this disorder,"i have been recovered for two years, weight restored, no true relapses, truly doing the waiting it out process of it getting easier and it's not getting any easier and the longer i live in this body and don't have my ed i don't want to live i don't want to work i don't want my friends i don't want fun trips i don't want anything i don't know how to change my mindset bc i try i really do try and then i feel my body or see myself and i have breakdowns and i can't imagine doing this forever forcing myself to stay healthy and also pretending to be happy with it like i know it's up to me to change my mindset but it sucks bc i've tried so hard and it's been so long and i wasn't even sick for a super super long time so it doesn't make sense to me im just losing hope lol all i'm asking is does anyone relate idk"
"I thought recovery would get easier, but instead it's getting harder","In the beginning I was so uncomfortably full all the time, trying to follow my assigned meal plan. I had to push myself to squeeze in all the food that's on there. My team said it would get easier as my stomach got used to more food - and it *sure* did. The combination of the 'honeymoon phase', my complete lack of hunger and fullness cues as well as just being soooooooo mentally hungry all. the. damn. time is wrecking havoc on my mental status. I eat all my meals and snacks, six times a day - but I can't stop myself from eating/snacking inbetween my scheduled meals as well! Don't get me wrong, I want to challenge myself but I want to do it when my brain is ready to follow along as well - right now, it's like my body is running on autopilot making me eat ALL THE THINGS and the anxiety and guilt doesn't hit until afterwards, and I immediately want to start skipping meals to rid myself of it. I'm not at a point in my recovery where I can challenge myself like this but it's like my body is doing it for me and I'm scared it's actually going to be something that derails my progress

Thanks I just needed to get that off my chest somewhere I can at least pretend someone is listening"
Never thought i'd get here but i have!,"hey y'all, just wanted to say this because last night i had a hard thought spiral of my old thinking patterns:
it's been about 4 months of recovery and only been 2 months since i fully stopped counting cals and i am astronomically happier already. i've been going to the gym and building hard earned muscle, i've gained a bunch of healthy weight through that and through eating plenty of good food and i've been on a BC pill which has contributed to the distribution of my body weight and i can actually say that i love myself and my body :') not all the time yet, but more often than not! it's so worth it! keep pushing through the hard urges, i believe in you"
Copious Amounts of Pepper In Food — Thoughts?,Basically the title — I find that most savoury foods taste so much better w/ copious amounts of black pepper/hot sauce
"Guys, it IS worth it!","From someone who's commited to recover for five months now, I assure y'all: it IS, indeed, worth it.

At first it's scary... At second, at third, at fourth, it'll ALWAYS be scary. But courage does not mean feeling confident all the time or not feeling scared. Courage is about keeping in mind that there are more important things and... Going even though you're scared. It's waking up and choosing recovery everyday, 'cause it's a choice we make everyday. Not saying people who aren't recoverying aren't brave, everyone is, bad days are totally understable.

And, look, I'd be lying if I said it's easy! It's not! Fighting against your own demons when they all live in your head is... Painful. It is! But I am so happy now! I am living at my fullest and going even higher! My hair stopped falling out, my body isn't tired all the time, I can walk properly, my sight is better, I am not sleepy all day long! My skin is beautiful and people keeps point about how my mood got ""bright"" again: I got my own personality back, the happy and humorous person I used to be... Not the one who was always angry, empty, numb... Starving. And, listen: I just stopped taking antidepressants (not on my own, my psychiatrist recommended me).

Not to mention, I am finally being able to sleep properly, I don't feel my stomach empty all the time and I haven't get a migraine in like two or three months. My grades are waaaay better and I am applying to jobs because I feel like I can finally do it. I went to a picnic with my boyfriend and didn't worry about calories or looking this or that! I enjoyed being there, truly! I am LIVING!

I know it takes A LOT of work and I am still at the beginning: not gonna lie telling y'all it's linear and I am smiling all the time. I struggle everyday, of course. But this was the first week since I developed anorexia that I could take a shower with lights on, dealing with my existence and body... And it didn't change anything. I didn't freak out. I am still me. Can you believe? Five years ago was the last time I took a shower while seeing my own body. 

For the first time in my life, I feel confident in my own skin. Happy to be me. I hope everyone here gets to recover properly and live their lives at fullest. Everybody deserves to be!"
does anyone have any advice on how to stop overeating?,"(sorry in advance if my backstory is unnecessarily long)

in the past, i used to have severe anorexia and would fast for multiple days empty-stomached. i’ve been in recovery for about 6 months now, but i find that i’ve been eating an excessive amount of food. even on the days that i do not overeat, i consume primarily junk food or foods extremely high in carbs. 

i know this is (semi) normal since my body is reacting to, like, actually having food in it but i still am eating a significantly unhealthy amount of food. 

i am not at all interested in relapsing and i am very happy with my current weight but nonetheless, i believe that my diet is becoming progressively more unhealthy 

if anyone has advice on how to prevent cravings or just how to limit myself from overeating in general, id love a reply!"
Holding back in recovery,"
For context I have been dealing with a state of quasi recovery for 3 weeks. It came after a severe relapse but. In the past 3 weeks I have worked with an outpatient team and been honest about my disordered behaviors with my parents. I told them that in the past 2 months (which is when this relapse happened) I had been throwing away and hiding practically all the meals they would give me as well as all the snacks. I lost a considerable amount of weight even lower than when I was hospitalized this most recent time (for malnutrition).
Yea it got bad. I felt stuck and we managed to slowly turn the boat around. But to be honest the past 3 weeks have been this gut reaching tug of war between letting go and going all in and the eating disorder continuing to battle for control. I guess I won’t beat around the bush any longer a part of me still hoped I can turn to the ED if things in recovery weren’t working. But that kind of went to shit yesterday when I spoke with a recovery Coach. I felt a sudden rush of adrenaline from our session and started to eat everything. It was very liberating but obviously afterwards came the greatest difficulty because the ED made me feel really guilty and I had a bunch of disordered thoughts. But to get to the crux of my question I noticed that I was overthinking a lot (fighting the immediate fear response) when choosing to eat food that I was highly scared of. Obviously I know this is normal and that I have to run towards the fear and do what is scary the most but then I went down a rabbit hole. So if I have to act on the things that give the ed, and consequently me, the most panic wouldn’t I just never be able to stop eating? If toast with peanut butter scares me I know I have to eat it, but let’s say how do I determine when I am actually still holding back in anyway. Because let’s take that toast with peanut butter if you add another table spoon it evens scarier, and another is even scarier. I mean you can go on and on, even adding different things on that slice of toast but just because, yes it’s exponentially more scary would I have to do it in order to “not hold back”. I noticed the eating disorder also made me feel guilty about this yesterday when I was grabbing snacks and noticed that it was very difficult even then to pick “the most challenging thing” for instance instead of the 100cal granola bars I ate, should I of eaten the cookies (that gave me more anxiety). The Ed kind of told me I was getting fat in vain, and not doing any rewiring. I felt really frustrated because I felt like a complete failure, I had failed at the ed, at restricting, and it felt like I was failing at recovery, and on top of that I had to deal with the mental torment of having just binged. Sorry this became a very long post but I just needed to vent and ask what others thought on this. Thank you so much for your time! 😊"

My situation is quite weird, I have move in a new apartement which is closer to my work than my previous one. I eat the same amount of food and I do less exercise. However, i'm feeling tired everytime i go back home. 
That's normal in our situation ?

"Anorexia Recovery, Extreme Hunger as an Adolescent Male","Perhaps it's related to the fact that I'm literally still growing in height as well, but is it normal to be ridiculously hungry even w/o working out?"
Keep eating after I’m full?,"I’ve reached that point in recovery where I’ve had enough of being anorexic, and I’m finally letting my body have the food it asks for. I mean, yesterday I ate way more than I thought possible, and despite it being scary I’m happy that I did. Though, when I feel really full, but my body still wants more, should I then still eat? Or should I wait a bit to see if it quietens down? I feel that I’d rather not make myself sick because I’ve eaten beyond capacity, and I’d like to have some, idk, discipline? Not just eat all the time and everywhere. I mean, if that’s what it takes to recover, I guess it’s worth it, but if i don’t need to, that would be great."
Feeling like a failure,I have always had a complicated relationship with food. I over ate as a coping mechanism when I was a child. As a teen I just stopped eating for years. Veganism brought me out of that for a little while. Everytime life gets too chaotic I stop eating. I go through periods where I don't care what my body looks like and then periods where I can't leave the house because I can't stand myself. I know people are just mocking me behind whispers. Every giggle from a stranger is my self hatred thrown back at me. Covid didn't help. I'm the largest I've been in 15 years. My teenage son is struggling with his weight and I want to be a good example for him but I've been purging. I don't know what to do. I hate my body. It's just too much. I got engaged this year and I'm dreading my wedding day. I keep asking to go to the courthouse. I don't want pictures of me like this. I haven't been in a picture in 2 years. I don't want to fall back into these habits but it's happening. The last time my thoughts got this bad I collected an Adderall and cocaine addiction. I can't go back there.. I don't have money for therapy. I don't know what to do.
People keep mentioning my weight loss and it hurts,"I’ve been in recovery for a few years now. I’ve come close to relapsing but my husband has been my biggest support and helps me with eating. I’ve come off of birth control in September and I’ve lost a lot of water weight, my face mostly. I discarded my full body mirror a year ago to help with my mental space (I became obsessed with looking in it) so I don’t have a general idea about how I look. I rarely go out but when I do atleast one person mentions how I’ve lost weight. They think they’re complimenting me but it’s not.

I found out I was pregnant in February. All these comments make me spiral into the thoughts of how much weight I’ll put on with the baby. I’ve debated staying of BC forever but I’m not sure how wise that’d be. I’m put in a rough space where I’m thinking about my weight again. I can’t afford to lose more without harming my child. It’s all coming right when I started wanting another mirror for belly progress pics but now I never want to see myself. 

I can’t afford to not eat, but I can’t stop hearing their words echo in my mind. 

All I’m thinking about is my baby, how do I get people to just shut up?"
Doess how long you restricted affect weight redistribution,
My sister refuses my health,"My sister has anorexia and 12BMI. She lives in another state and keeps losing weight and I am terrified she’ll faint somewhere and no one will be there to take care of her. 
I keep telling her I want to move in with her so she can go under surgery for tube. She wants tube, too. She won’t talk to her doctors and waiting for feeling so bad to go to emergency. Like, she doesn’t make sense and keeps yelling at me when I want to help. I understand she wants self autonomy and stuff but shit is killing her. What should I do? Should I convince her? How? Omg I am freaking out!"
Male recovery problem ?,"For 1 week, I suffer of a little pain on the right nipple.
I know that is because of hormons. 
However, I would like to know if this is normal.
You must know that I eat miso and soy sauce every week"
Do hunger cues ever come back,"I've read so many things about how hunger cues will come back once you start eating regularly, and I know from past recovery attempts, I've always dealt with extreme hunger. I'm going on almost a year now with literally zero appetite, zero hunger cues. It's to the point that eating makes me feel nauseous and full really quickly. It's so frustrating. I feel like I would struggle less with sticking to meal plans if I felt hungry, but because I don't, I feel greedy and like I don't deserve to eat 

Am I SOL or is there a sliver of hope that they someday might return? :-("

Biological treatment method for anorexia?,"Are you guys aware of any treatment methods of this sort?

Feelings towards ED,"I have been struggling a lot with my ed and I've been sharing a lot and I've reached this point where I'm almost embarrassed to share with my regular eda fellows about these struggles because I don't feel like i'm moving in any healthy direction. I've been up for over 2 hours. I still haven't eaten my breakfast I am struggling to eat.

I realized in reflecting on my actions that the underlying motive is that. I'd rather feel the pain of being hungry than the sadness about things that are really upsetting me in my life."
Struggling with stress and grief,"So the last few months have seen a rise in my traumatic stress (triggers, contact from people who hurt me). My uncle also passed away this week after a few years living with cancer - the last couple of weeks of his life were very emotional and stressful but he died peacefully. All of this has increased my ed thoughts and chew/spit behaviours especially and I wish I had a better coping mechanism. When things get hard I tend to punish myself rather than find a healthy way to cope. I see a psychologist and dietitian so do have medical support. Would love any advice or help."
Condiments before and during recovery,Hi there. I was wondering what yalls experience was with using condiments (like salt and hot sauce) before and during your recovery journey. I have been thinking a lot about this because I tend to overuse salt a lot(like alottt) aswell as hot sauce.
My (28F) recovery: questions,"Hello everyone,

(this text might be a little triggering to everybody with an 'almond mom' as they are called nowadays so proceed this first paragraph with caution. Anything after that should be fine.)

I have been restricting food since I was about 12 years old. When I got in puberty my body changed rapidly to a more curvier body type. My mom was always the sporty type. She was literally scared of fatty foods and she was an amateur body builder. So that's the environment I grew up in. When I started puberty and started 'filling out' I got a tummy and that's when she started putting me on diets to 'lose weight'. Voila, the seed for my ED was planted. I will not go in details further.

Fast forward to today. I have always been restricting. But I realized this is a deeply ingrained pattern of both my teenage years and wanting to have control over myself and my emotions (I am diagnosed with autism). I also started skipping/being late in periods and not feeling well at all. Never had pro treatment for ED (in my country there is a weight maximum for these kinds of treatments, and me being on the taller side meant there was no way for me to be at that weight). I am also not interested in any more therapy.

So I decided to recover. About a year ago. I relapsed a couple of times. I relapsed this week and I am getting back on track now. Over all, doing great. I filled out a LOT. I actually love my body now. But I have QUESTIONS. There are things happening to me that I don't know if they are due to me getting older or me recovering and gaining weight, or maybe some other cause. It feels like I am going through puberty for the second time, that's the way I describe it.

Does ANY of these things sound normal or relatable to others here? Have other women gone through the same thing?

* My period is different every month. From most other women I hear their blood loss, level of pain, is pretty on par for their usual course. Sometimes I am bleeding a lot, losing clots and leaking through my leggings. Sometimes its light and over in three days. Sometimes I can't lay still because I am in so much pain, other months it doesn't bother me at all and its only light cramping. Could it be that my body is 'confused'? Hormone swings?
* I can't feel hunger cues until I almost faint.
* When I eat, I have to eat small meals, multiple times/day. I get stomach pains and heartburn quickly. Sometimes I eat less than a toddler and I am full. Full as in stomach pains full.
* Bloating. I hold down SO MUCH water. My ankles. My face looks different. I thought I had a double chin, but I think its bloating. My lip fillers swell double/triple its size in the morning. Also, my stomach is bloated after eating. Very distended. Is this normal? Will it go away?
* Dat ass. I filled out in my ass and hips enormously. I literally look like a tall Kim Kardashian. While previously I always had a 'flat ass'.
* My boobs have gotten slightly bigger. But they've also changed dramatically. Previously, I had what you could describe as 'tuberous breasts' (look it up). Now that I am starting to gain even more weight, they are filling out and they look... 'normal'? Is it possible my restricting during puberty blocked my boob growth somewhat?
* I feel I have aged rapidly. Im 28 now and I look so much older. Or it could be that the hyperfixation is moving from my body to my skin"
Boyfriend found old pictures of me before my relapse.,"My boyfriend was scrolling through his camera roll & just showing me old photos and he stumbled across photos he took of me when I was waiting to get a piercing.
He looked at the picture with the same expression I haven’t seen in awhile, a look of only happiness & no worry. He asked me if he “could have that back” (what I looked like before relapsing) and gently asked me if I could gain weight back & even said he would gain with me.
I genuinely thought he was displeased with how I looked before, but I was wrong.
I want to recover so badly, but I’m so terrified of being chubby again. I’m at such a huge loss."
Is this a win?,"context, I have already been several attempts in recovery, lately I have dealt a lot with a lot of shit around me and more when extreme hunger is appearing (again).
So what happens?, Well my extreme hunger usually appears at night, around dinner time (7 to 10 PM), the thing here is, I am trying not to purge or compensate Lately I have had a lot of problems maintaining my meal plan (you know, 3 snacks and 3 meals) Without Any wloss purpose but when extreme hunger arrives I do not limit it by any means, Because I know that the more I pay attention to it, the less frequent it will be.

What's going on? I think I'm starting to feel good about my tummy feeling full and good, I feel weirdly calm about saying ""I'm not hungry anymore"", I often feel like ""fuck this and it'll be my last meal of the day, fuck i cant wait to the next morning im so hungry"" at night, but then when this happens is just like ""well, until the next morning"" As if it were normal

Is this a win? Is this one step closer to being recovered?"
how to deal with perhaps anorexic friend when you’re in recovery,"i have been in recovery for almost a month now. i’m eating whatever i want so i’ve obviously been gaining apparent weight. Sometimes i does get to me emotionally but with the help of my family i manage to get through it most of the time.

However, im still in highschool and i have a friend group which formed since we were young. I cant leave it since there are only four of us. One of the girls in there (my best friend) starts starving herself at lunch and claiming she isn’t hungry. She started doing this after she saw my extreme restrict (when i was deep in my ed) She always talk about how she’s not dieting and that she hates diet culture while bragging how she manage to not eat breakfast and throw 3/4 of the food she buy at lunch every single day. 

This is extremely triggering to me since i’m trying to recover. Every time i see her restrict or eats extremely small portion of food at lunch, it reminds me of my anorexic self and really makes me want to relapse. I’m so tired but i cant get out of this. I hate myself and how i allow her to play with my emotions. (she has always been like this since we were young) I really don’t know what to do

please give me some advice thank you"
weight gain is making me slightly depressed,so i’m currently like 3? almost 4 months into starting to eat more frequently and not restrict myself and it’s starting to get to me. like eating always give me bad stomach gas that bloats my stomach badly and all my new weight is sitting in my stomach making all my clothes look terrible and make me feel so ugly. i try to talk to my bf about it but he just tells me i’m beautiful anyways and it doesn’t matter but it does to me and it’s making me feel really bad about myself
im gonna start trying again,"i still have a lot of disordered thoughts, but im trying to learn how to get a body im okay with in a healthy way. im trying to learn how to eat enough to sustain myself and get the right amount of nutrients and stuff. im trying to exercise more, but not solely to burn calories, more to actually get fit and in shape. im seeing how long i can go without any b/p stuff. im trying, and i think it might actually work. i think for once it might fucking work. all it took for me to try was seeing that there's better ways to do this, i don't need to fucking starve myself to get to a point where i like my body lol

the best part is, i only fully started with what im doing today, and i dont feel guilty for eating full meals at all, i feel really good about it actually! idk how long this will last, but it's working right now, which means there's hope for me again"
how do you afford to recover?,"no but really. I’ve been struggling with anorexia on and off since childhood, I know it has its roots in anxiety, I lose my appetite when I’m anxious and I’m ~always~ anxious. I do not have a preoccupation with my weight or a particular desire to be thin, quite the opposite, just an aversion to food itself.

It’s gotten particularly bad in the last few years, to the point I rarely feel the sensation of hunger. If I stretch too long without eating a bite, like several days, then I’ll start feeling extreme nausea but that’s it. I genuinely can’t afford to eat three big healthy meals a day as much as I want to. I don’t even think I’d be able to stomach that much food. When I do sit down to a full meal, which is rarely, my stomach starts cramping and I feel full after just a few bites.

I genuinely want to gain weight but the fact I can’t afford to eat well, coupled with the fact I’ve trained my body to survive on incredibly small amounts, just feels like an impossible mountain to climb. I know it can’t go on like this forever, I know I need to eat well to survive but there are so many obstacles.

If I can’t afford to buy my “safe” foods, I’m unable to eat at all and I never experience cravings of any kind. Food has become an exhausting chore and the entire ordeal, buying it, cooking it, and eating it is psychologically and physically taxing. I don’t know where I’m going with this it’s just a meandering vent I guess, have a good day/night"
Will I ever recover?,"I wanted to, but I’m still ambivalent and engaging in behaviors. I love this and I hate the fact that I love this. How do I go about this?"
Anorexia binge restrict cycle,"
I have been diagnosed with anorexia for two years now I survive on three protein bars a day and when I eat it turns into a binge and then I immediately weigh myself and then I start restricting again because I feel so guilty and ashamed of what I've done I really want to get out of this vicious cycle I just don't know what to do every morning I wake up and say that today I'm going to start recovery but then the voice in my head is so strong that it keeps on shouting at me not to eat and just to wait until I get to my safe number on the scale but when I get to that safe number I just want to go down even more I'm so hungry I'm starving I'm exhausted I'm so tired but I just don't know how to stop this vicious circle I have food on my mind 24/7 and it is killing me I am extremely underweight am 41 years old and I am ashamed of myself that even at 41 years old the most important thing to me is not eating so who cares if I out weight on will it really be the end of the world I keep saying this to my to myself everyday but it don't make a difference has anybody else been in a similar situation like mine and how did you overcome the voices in your head I just feel like this anorexia is not gonna leave me alone until it kills me"

Feeling gross and ashamed,"So to sum it all up, I’ve been in recovery for about a year and I seem to be weight restored. I’m slowly coming to terms with my new body and all the bloating but I’m having a hard time feeling ashamed about all the recovery symptoms I’m experiencing. I still feel extremely exhausted physically to the point where standing for more than 20 min makes me want to pass out. Because of this, I have a lot of trouble taking care of myself and my surroundings. My dishes haven’t been washed in weeks (even though I literally have a dishwasher. I just don’t have the energy to even load it and unload it). I have to hype myself up to shower bc getting off my couch to then stand for a few minutes just feels like too much. If I had to describe the exhaustion, it’s like my body has been drained of all my blood. My blood tests have never shown anything abnormal so I’m assuming my body is still healing all the damage. I damaged my body significantly so it makes sense and I understand I need to be patient. However, I just feel so bad about myself bc I can barely take care of myself. My hair gets greasy so much faster now. I get overheated after eating usually so I sweat constantly. My skin is so dry and flaky. I want to take care of myself so much better bc I really value it, but I truly don’t have the energy. Just moving my arms is too much. It feels like I’ve been hit by a truck. I’m so ashamed of my friends or anyone really seeing me like this. I know a lot of them assume I’m immature, lazy, and probably gross because they don’t know the whole story. Even my close friends who do know the story seem to forget. I told my one friend today about how I haven’t done my dishes in a while and they just replied “dude.” It makes me feel so undeserving of relationship with other people. I don’t even have the energy to paint my nails :( I need to do some online shopping to get new bras but even that sounds exhausting. I just nap and watch tv and hope that one day I can take care of myself the way I want to. I know some of this sounds like depression, but honestly the only thing making me depressed is the fact that I can’t move my body. It always aches. To top it all off, I developed GI issues and pelvic floor issues which make me feel even grosser. Like seriously I pee a little when I sneeze and I can’t control it. I just feel so disgusting and lame. I can’t imagine anyone ever liking me until I get better. I’m doing my best to get better, but I know I can’t exactly control my body’s timeline. I just wish recovery didn’t make me feel so gross."

Advice,"Today is my first day in recovery and I’m so confused
For a little background, I was overweight and hated myself so I started dieting and that completely spiraled and I ended up downloading a tracking app, becoming obsessive over logging/weighing my food, I workout every day with no stop.  I also restricted to xxx cals. This went on for about 4-6 months.  I ended up being barely underweight, which makes me feel really invalid, but yesterday I visited a dietician and got diagnosed with anorexia and BDD.  She told me if I didn’t gain 1-2 lbs a week, I would have to go inpatient.  Somehow I still feel invalid.  Im taking baby steps and eating about 1000 calories a day while continuing my workouts.  I just feel like I’m undeserving of recovery because I never reached that “near death” point and I was never very underweight.  I’m still very scared to gain and still see myself as not “fat” but not “skinny”  What should I do?  Why is my mind like this?  How do I stop feeling invalid?"

"Anyone in recovery needs this. There is a song called running by NF, that has been encouraging me and made me feel relatable in some since. Hope you all a successful life away from your eating disorders, and remember your not eating to get bigger but to get a bigger life.",
I don’t enjoy food anymore,"I’m supposed to get to the lower middle of a healthy bmi but I’ve had to eat so much all the time to get there over the last two months (no choice in what to eat/how much/when) that nothing tastes good to me anymore. Even things I liked before the disorder just…are whatever. It’s just more stuff to shove into my mouth. I’m so sick of pretty much everything by now. Sweet things, salty thing, savory things. I don’t know if this is better for me overall because I won’t want to eat when I’m not hungry once I’m done, but it’s frustrating when even “special” meals just feel so monotonous. I don’t look forward to any meals, not in a bad way exactly? Just like “oh, yeah, have to do this again…” and it’s annoying. I was wondering if professionals do this on purpose?"
High Calorie Protein Shakes,"Does anyone have any experience with those Boost high-calorie shakes? My disorder completely destroyed my appetite, and I'm having a really hard time eating my base calories, let alone any extra, to help me gain weight. I figured it's a whole lot easier to drink your calories, so I bought these Boost shakes. I'm nervous it will make my stomach hurt, as high protein all at once usually does. Anyone have any insight? 

Also, if anyone has any suggestions to fix my broken appetite, I'm all ears. It's not that I don't want to eat (anymore). I just physically can't. I start gagging even while eating my favorite foods."
My fear of bread doesn't translate to pot pies!,"So very recently my fear of bread resurfaced. So bread and bagels make me visibly anxious and noticably shake. However had a pot pie for breakfast to hit my intake for my depression meds, and I was only shaking for it being too much food. But I was able to eat the pot pie, and ate all of it! Definitely feels like it's nap time thought."
Happy two years of recovery for me! I’m happy to report I’m now fully recovered.,"Today marks the second year of my anorexia recovery!  I was severely ill for 16 years, my eating disorder started when I was a preteen with extremely abusive parents restricting my food intake to make and keep me underweight. I was crying over bad body image by age 7 and fully anorexic by age 11. I was only treated with a shred of decency when I was a size 2 or 0 (or even smaller than that), so I perpetuated the harm in adulthood.  Every person in my immediate family, plus my grandfather, had restrictive eating disorders.  I had to initiate and maintain no contact not only for all the abuse I’ve been through, but also because I was essentially raised in an eating disorder cult.

Two years ago, I *really* didn’t want to recover and it was super scary going against everything t I have ever known.  But I did it.  I was extremely emaciated and was actively dying.  So I had only had two choices: go all-in immediately, or die within 2 months. I went all in 110% starting the first day and never relapsed or restricted in any way.  I did it without professional help too.  I saved my own life and the *only* reason I recovered was to save my physical health.  It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  But I did it!  I never thought mental recovery and good body image would be possible for me, but now I am happy to report I’m  fully recovered!  I became entry level plus sized during recovery (which was very rough for a long time because I had been skinny my whole life), andd now I am MUCH more comfortable in my own skin and confident (!) then when I was small and very conventionally attractive. 

I feel better about myself now than I EVER have despite being a completely different size.  I finally am able to see myself as everyone else does and call myself cute and pretty.  And it’s funny because once I fully accepted my current body, some of the overshoot weight is coming off naturally with no restriction like I knew it would one day.  Now my next leg in recovery is making sure I eat exactly what my body is asking for and not attaching emotions to the upcoming weight loss.  It’s nothing inherently worth celebrating.  The pounds shed off are certainly nothing to celebrate or get excited about, since that is just as disordered as shaming myself for gaining weight.  It’s just what my body needs to do at this stage of my recovery and I can smile knowing that it’s because I am fully recovered and my body fully trusts that I will give it what it needs and that I won’t starve it ever again.  I’ll continue to stay away from the scale and I have no expectations for what I will look like after this phase.

So happy two years to me once again!  I truly believe that if I can Fully recover, anyone can.  I want to be an eating disorder recovery coach one day and I can’t wait to help a whole bunch of people, whoever is meant to find me."
Been feeling so fat recently,"That it. Just been feeling whale-ish. Still throwing down the meals but i’m getting right back to where I started before the ED and it just feels like shit. Sure, im proud of myself, but I just can’t help grazing my hand over the growing rolls on my tummy or feeling the absence of my jawline. I try and remind myself my sun total is so much more than those things but they’re all I see."
joint pain,"ive been in recovery for about 3 months now and i have barley exercised at all except for short walks. recently, my body has just started aching w sm pain, especially in my lower back and ribs. idk if this has to do w a lack of exercise bc its not like im laying down all day, plus i have great posture and do yoga everyday. i also got a bone density scan and i had an A T score of -1.5 so not rlly good. just including that in case it may be relevant. is this something normal that happens in recovery?"
need advice with boyfriends eating habits,"Hi, lately my boyfriend has been eating less and less and says it’s because he just has no appetite. And i know thats not his fault, i’m
not angry with him or anything. I’ve expressed that i’d like him to eat something atleast because lately he has gone until like 5pm until eating. He does atleast eat dinner and usually snacks before bed. I’m not concerned that he is developing disordered eating, because he genuinely doesn’t care about what he eats or anything. It’s just hard for me to not relapse knowing he hasn’t eaten yet. I don’t feel like I should eat if he hasn’t, it makes me feel fat if that makes sense. I really don’t want to relapse, i want to get better but i just can’t bring myself to eat or at least justify eating if he hasn’t eaten yet.

TL;DR: Boyfriend isn’t eating much lately, i’m trying not to relapse over it due to guilt. 

Any advice?"
working out is harder,"im weight restoring and i just reached a healthy weight but I've noticed I'm more tired from exercise and need more breaks. i don't feel stronger, tbh i just feel weaker, even tho i look stronger. can anyone explain this?"
Am I broken,"For context I have struggled with eating disorders for the past 3 years. First it was anorexia and only restriction. In my first recovery attempt I developed binge eating and because of the rapid weight gain I entered in panic and began to try to restrict again. I started a binge restrict cycle for a very long time. I would not eat or only eat non calorically dense foods, almost in anticipation that I would binge at night. I am going to be honest and say that I even enjoyed it in some sense. It made me feel like I earned it and knew I would maybe still gain weight but because of my restriction throughout the day at a hopefully slower rate.
Eventually I reached a point where I just felt really bad about my body and quit eating all the high calorically and highly palatable foods I ate at night. But the issue was that more than the type of food I was eating I had kind of gotten a habit of restricting and eating a large volume of food at once. I’m order to get the satisfaction of being able to continue my binge but loose weight I started to binge on very low calorically dense foods. By the end of it I ate the same enormous, quantity of broccoli, cauliflower, salad, baby’s carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, and cabbage. Over time I started to loose weight but still continue to eat pounds on pounds of raw and boiled veggies at night. I am starting recovery again after being hospitalized, due to medical concerns from malnutrition. I am bat shit scared at the fact that I simply can’t seem to feel satisfied. I am really afraid that my brain will permanently be use to eating such a large volume of food, and that I will never be able to regularize my eating. Will my stomach eventually shrink? 
Sorry I know this is a long post but any help is greatly appreciated!"
Advice for eating out with new boss,"So, I’m in college, and I just got my first co op position for this coming fall! My new boss invited me to dinner to meet one of his assistants and talk about the position. Of course, because I can’t have nice things, I internally freaked out because I’m going to need to deal with going to a restaurant and eat without looking weird. I don’t know what restaurant it is, fingers crossed it’ll have safe options, but if it doesn’t idk my next move. I’m very tempted to restrict the day of or the day after, but I know I can’t do that the day of the meeting because the brain fog I get from that could make me mess up the dinner. I get terrible headaches and lose all sense of focus whenever I restrict- it didn’t used to be this bad idk what happened. Plus I’ve been doing well in recovery thus far; I have a dietician and a therapist, and I really don’t want to deal with restriction anymore because it really does suck and I know if I start doing it, I just won’t stop. I already recently had a couple weeks of slipping back into old habits which were caused by just one day of restricting, which is what led me to seek help from a dietitian. I know at this point I can’t afford to do that again. I just hate that something as exciting for me as my first job is being tarnished by this bullshit already. So, does anyone have any advice lol?"
Going off birth control,I’ve had an ED for about three years now and have been on birth control for all of that. I’ve been taking a combination of Dienogest/Ethinylestradiol and now my doctor wants me to go off it to determine whether I have a natural period. Does anyone have any experience with going off birth control in recovery? Did you have any side effects or anything?
"my gf may have anorexia, she does want to gain weight, how do I support her?","I'm not sure if she counts as having an ED but she does have disordered eating habits. She gets cold very easily and has a weak immune system, which she admits is due to low bodyweight and restrictive eating. She has bouts of self-hatred and uses exercise as self-punishment. She had said that before she met me, she used to be even thinner and be even more restrictive. I'm worried for her physical health and have mentioned that, so now she is trying to eat more, but this means she is now running against that self-hatred, and urges to restrict the day after or over-exercise or start purging. 

She says it helps her when I tell her I love her, and when I describe loving her. But now I'm worried that every time my writing compliments her appearance, I'm entrenching the potential eating disorder. At the same time, it would quite hard for me to write about her without bringing up her appearance at all, and she seems to really appreciate me calling her pretty in various ways. How do I make sure I'm not enabling said ED? I have tried mentioning that if she gains weight, it is likely to make her curvier, which is also something she does really want for herself (except that she is also scared that the weight goes to the wrong places, of course). In any case, now every time I write about her current body and use words like ""lithe"", I question myself.

Also how do I support her more in general? I'm cautious about seeming too pushy and naggy. There have been times where she points out she has bodily autonomy, and I cannot tell her to change her body for my sake, which is true, so I've been careful to stick to language that simply airs my concern for her health, and saying she can do what she wants but I have feelings on said health because I love her. What about when she has the urge to purge (although thankfully she has never done that yet), what should I say? 

Food-wise she is comfortable eating around me, which is rare for her to feel around people, but she still eats surprisingly little. I usually eat by myself, but she often offers to cook for me. When she does cook for me, I notice that she doesn't mind eating the last few bites that I may not be able to finish. Although yeah I feel like her meal should be more than just one or two bites. Should I let her cook for me more, and then I deliberately leave more leftovers and encourage her to eat it? I don't know if that is considered manipulative and whether it might backfire.

This is turning into a ramble, and yeah I know she should seek therapy, I am encouraging that, but I want to know what I can do to help her in everyday life too. Should I focus more on addressing the root causes of her restriction than encouraging her to eat? (abandonment fears, fearing losing control and turning obese, feeling she needs to be perfect to be loved, etc)."
I fear that my recovery is going too good??,"I'm onlu on day 4 but I'm already eating 1000 calories and limited my steps to 10000-13000 steps daily and I'm doing fine.

Which makes ne feel like i did fake my ed [atypical ana so i already feel unvalid for never reaching an underweight bmi]


Is this normal???"
How long until my hair starts to grow back?,"(English is not my first language, so I apologize for any grammatical mistake) 

A little more context. After not having my period for over a little more than a year due to the abuse I did to my body, and after several months of trying to go back to before all this happened, about five/six months ago I got it back. I know this is a good sign when it comes to recovery, but I haven't seen baby hairs growing back and I keep loosing hair everytime I take a shower. 

Basically, just what it says in the title. I'm just curious about how long it took you guys for your hair to grow back after recovery."
struggling with binging,"hi! new to reddit and this sub, I thought it might be a good place to try to get input from people who’ve gone through similar experiences/are more near my age group? (mid teen)

so I stopped restricting heavily last april, but was really in quasi and was still losing weight throughout summer. once school started I was maintaining and able to concentrate much better, but still kinda holding back. then the holidays hit and I really wanted to join in the festivities and ended up eating a lot and gaining like 2lb, and then in about mid-feb i suddenly started getting really strong mental hunger and i decided to go “all in” and start honoring cravings. but it’s been all downhill since then - i think i’ve gained like 10lb, gone through like 3 relapses, mental health has absolutely TANKED (literally crying daily), unable to focus on studies, and I end up eating endless snacks every night and ending up uncomfortably full and sick. it’s like I can’t stop eating, even when I don’t even want the food.

does anyone know how to get the compulsive eating to stop? i know the usual answer is to make sure to eat enough during the day, but i’ve tried and it simply isn’t working. i’m terrified i’ve formed a new habit, and to make matters worse, the eating usually takes place in my bed so i’m getting really bad insomnia. just binged on easter chocolate and peeps and i’m disgusted with myself. any and all advice is welcome, really sorry for how long winded this got! 💛"
Anyone experienced/experiencing depersonalization in recovery ? Will this ever go away?,"I’ve understood you can’t strictly make any conclusions about this without having a scientific base. This is a disorder that affects the entire body , and because of that, I can’t just think about this in terms of “missing my old body” because I hated that body just as much as I hate this one; that disconnection is something I’m just gonna have to live with . Depersonalization, on the other hand, seems like something too difficult to continue living with . 

What I’m wondering is if the increased cortisol from starving literally just causes such a burn-out , emotions could no longer have some type of self-identification anymore and the “self” is no longer present because of just how damaged the brain becomes from starving . When your brain enters such a primitive , feral state, the ego breaks but can it be reconstructed again somehow ? 

Does anyone experience or has experienced this and knows if it’ll go away? It’s hard to think I’m always going to feel like a ghost of my pre-ED self and I’m 28...so my brain is obviously passed the developmental stage. This shit is hell all around."
Recovery,"I ran into an old high school teacher earlier this evening. His eyes kept taking in this body that I have now. When he was my teacher, I probably weiged about 78 lbs at 17 years old. I have managed to leave the anorexia behind (for now). But, I weigh around 180 now and I'm only 5' 2"". It  really makes me insecure to be this big."
Motto?,"What’s a recovery focused motto, phrase, or quote you’ve heard that stuck with you? At the treatment center I go to we have to say a motto as part of the check out process everyday and I’m curious to hear some ideas. 
Some examples 
- there is no meal that can hurt me more than my ED can
- I can do hard things"
compulsive movement,"
it’s very wierd to explain, i am restoring weight, eating a lot and enough to be healthy (which i really want to be) however i just hate sitting down and staying still. i have just recently relapsed after being happy with myself and happy relationship with my body, but now it’s all messed up again and i don’t know how to explain. the more food that gets added to my plan (have been with a team for 2+ years) the more it makes me uncomfortable physically, so to compensate for that i often don’t allow myself to sit down and just sort of really fidget a lot, not with the intent of loosing weight, but just to balance out the massive ive amount of food. it’s just a suffocating spiral. my knees and legs hurt so bad and i don’t know how much longer i can keep this up."
Trying on clothes is the absolute f***ing worst !!!,"How do people do it? How do people just go right into a fitting room with ease and come out smiling,  showing off their clothes to their friends, actually feeling good about themselves?!!  

I can’t stand it. Idc how many years I’m in recovery. It’s not making much of a difference. My body is an invader. I can’t think of it as my “own”; it’s something outside of me; it’s something that’s covering me but I cannot identify with it or say that’s it’s “mine” at all.

The weight gain has not made my mind become “normal”;my mind is just no longer starved, but I wish it could just be normal. I wish I could see the way I really look. I wish I could take pictures, try on clothes and just feel an inch of security for a change . I wish I didn’t feel this complete detachment to the body I’m in.

The “it gets better” comments don’t help this. I know I’m no longer a psychotic frail animal whose life only revolves around starving and planning on what to eat next . But that’s only a consequence of anorexia. The sensations and feelings which caused my ED in the first place are still there; they might never get better .

End rant."
advice,"i relapsed w anorexia summer 2019, it has taken me to rly rly low places of extreme hunger (eating around moldy food, eating food out of trash, etc.) diagnosed anemia/low in hemoglobin, tasting weird metal flavor in my mouth (?), dizziness to almost fainting (forgot the diagnosis my doc gave me) , lots of bruising, substance abuse to suppress appetite (xanex and adderal), ibs (severe diarrhea on a daily basis),and now blood work that says my kidneys are low or high in creatine (whatever it is that shows extreme dehydration from starvation/ana)…. i have also been hospitalized before as a teenager but for bulimia and also have received cosmetic procedures (extremely painful) bc of how severe my body dysmorphia is (i model in nyc). 

i am attempting to recover as of the last month and i have been realizing structuring my days with set meal times have been helping. i am awaiting approval from outpatient program (delaying bc of bad state insurance) but i foresee a brighter future as i take things day by day. we can do this!!!!! 

**also i am off the xanex as of 1 yr and lowering my intake on stimulants, truly not glamorizing or flexing on how bad i have been in this illness, i just am reaching out for support and need advice. plz b tender.**"
Energy,"I’m so tired, I worked a 6 hour shift yesterday with a single 15 minute break. The other 5hr and 45 minutes I had to stand at the fitting room. My legs are so sore, it’s hard for me to get to class from walking up the stairs. Even when I am not working, I am just so exhausted. Now it’s making my life so much more difficult, how can I get my energy back? What can I do? Im so over feeling like this."
New here! Need advice :),"Hi! I’m 20F who’s always switching from a state of relapse + recovery. Backstory: My worst was in 2020 with the start of covid. Being isolated i was able to hide the fact I was losing so much weight from my friends and extended family. I’m hispanic so comments on being “too skinny” are common. I’ve never fully recovered but I have made a lot of progress with body image/ eating habits. Now i’m just training my brain to get hungry again bc that’s the main issue I still struggle with. 

Anyways, what I wanted to talk about is now i’m getting older, done with puberty and now I feel behind with my body because I’m still smaller than my peers. I want to grow boobs and start working out but to gain weight. (having bigger boobs is common for the women in my family) I was wondering if any women here got their boobs and butt back after gaining weight healthily after an ED. I’m afraid that I won’t gain in the areas I want ever again or that it’ll trigger me again seeing the weight only grow in areas i dislike on me."
Fatty liver disease,I've recently discovered that I have liver problems and potentially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (still in testing process). I didn't even know it was a possible condition to get following ANA /ED. Has anyone else been through this or a liver condition and has tips to recover from it? Or will it be a permanent condition?
i am terrified to get better.,"i think the years of restricting are finally catching up to me. the past few weeks i feel terrible. i’ve had a splitting headache everyday for almost two weeks now, it gets so bad my eyes hurt to move and even my neck and back starts to hurt. i’m starting to get really dizzy and nauseous and my mom made me a doctors appointment but im not sure how they’re gonna help. i know the reason why i feel like this, but i can’t tell them exactly what it is. everyone knows i don’t eat enough. but it never really crosses anyones mind because when i do eat i eat something unhealthy. im so tired of being unhealthy. the only food really available to me lately has been fast food, and not just that fast food is my comfort. its what ive grown up on. and i grew up with people telling me i will be fat because of it. now i eat it and cant get myself to eat anything after and then its offered to me again when im absolutely starving and cant turn it down. i need help but i feel like my mom wont believe me because of the fast food. i really really dont want to im loving how small ive been but i have to reach out soon. im genuinely worried about my health and my future."
How do you make yourself want to recover?,I don’t have any motivation to do so myself
Recovery food freedom,"I’ve been having McDonald’s cravings lately and I’ve eaten 4 McDonald’s this week in recovery 
Is this bad?"
I miss having a personality,"It's so hard to keep trying when I still feel so absolutely numb. No hunger cues, no emotions of any kind, zero interest in hobbies, zero energy so I can't even play video games or go for walks because I'm so exhausted. Don't like seeing friends, barely enjoy seeing my partner. It all feels pointless. I don't feel any better after gaining weight and I'm having the worst time finding help. Hospital wouldn't take me bc they said I was too sick, PHP wouldn't take me bc of the same reason, can't go out of state for treatment. ED therapists around here won't take my insurance so I can't afford to work with anyone bc it's like $190 weekly for Ed or trauma therapy. And the ones that do are booked for literal months, that's why this relapse got so bad in the first place. 

I've been doing this all on my own and I'm glad I gained weight, I was absolutely miserable and know I was close to death. But my head just feels... Empty. It's been 17 long years now of this cycle: lose a ton of weight very fast, something dramatic happens, then I try to stabilize, but I never can get proper Ed specific treatment so I just sit hand in hand with the disorder until it decides to wake up and be a bully again. 

I'm so stupid now from the brain fog, I can't remember anything, not even important dates like when I got married. I'm like a zombie and don't know what to do. I know I still need to gain a lot more weight to weight restore, I need to eat more nutritious foods, and I need to find a treatment team but it's impossible when you're broke and the healthcare system doesn't care about you. The state I live in offers literally no Ed support, it's atrocious. 

Idk I'm sorry I'm ranting, I'm just so tired and out of ideas. I don't feel like I'll ever beat this thing. I'm accepting I won't ever be the same again. This recent relapse really destroyed me, both mentally and physically."
Contradictions in a sick mind.,"This is more vent than anything.
It's very screwed up when it comes to thinking about being in a TRUE recovery (and not in the mediocre recovery I'm in, I am ready to let go of my diseased body, I hate the pain when sitting or leaning on a firm flat surface, I feel ashamed when the wind pulls me and let's not even talk about how horrible my skin feels (it's extremely dry and cold), i feel so pathetic Because even though I'm willing to leave it, a part of me feels very comfortable and safe to be sick, it feels so good to feel in the bones and especially to feel so ill... I know what I'm saying is horrible but it's the pure truth, I still try to leave my body aside (because I know I'm more than that) but it's fucking horrible wanting to leave a place but at the same time feeling so safe there.
I want to stop feeling this sick but what will happen when I no longer feel this way? Will I feel better? I am aware that what I have to work on the most is my mind and my mentality and I am doing well with it (I'm facing fear foods, breaking rules and above all facing the idea that I won't be able to stay in my ed forever [and that I'll either die or i'll recover, the two faces of the same coin]) But still sometimes I worry that my body changes before my mentality... It's not going like this, in fact my mind is clearer sometimes, More healthy than my body for moments lmao.
I hate the conflicting ideas that come to the fore at this point in the recovery."
Hungry but not craving,"I am at the beginning of what I think is my extreme hunger, but I have big problems with my hunger clues, I have not the slightest idea of ​​what my body wants to eat, What is it that my body craves or similar things And that is making it difficult for me to pay attention to my extreme hunger. Does anyone have any advice? How can I honor my EH without so much mourning about what my body wants or craves? How can I find out what I'm craving for ? :("
Feeling comfortable in my skin,"Hi everyone! 
I’ve been on my healing journey for over almost two years now. I got a Breast Augmentation last July after losing 90% of my breast tissue and never gaining it back.  I’m in a support group on Facebook for ladies that have gotten a BA and it’s very helpful but what they don’t talk about is body dysmorphia. Sometimes I have days that I’m obsessed with my body and how far I’ve come and I also have days where I feel like they make me look huge. Don’t get me wrong I don’t regret it at all and it has made me feel so much more feminine again. Tomorrow I’m going to put on a bikini for the first time this summer. I just spent 30 minutes staring at my naked body in the mirror thinking about how awful I will look next to all of my friends. (They are active at the gym and don’t struggle with an ED(I keep myself out of the Gym for that reason)) I just need some kind words to hype me up for this experience. I’m going back and forth between bikini or baggy shirt and I feel like if I don’t wear a bathing suit I will be taking a step back in my recovery and I don’t want to ruin my progress. Last summer I didn’t go to the beach at all because I just dove into work to avoid it. I’m just spiraling a bit and feeling guilty for indulging myself lately. Everyone around me is dieting and I hate asking them to keep the diet talk to a minimum because I don’t want to burden them with my problems."
is overeating to feel full healthy?,"i still feel as though my stomach is small and unable to take a lot of food at a time, but not feeling full makes me feel like i’m relapsing. so i try to overeat, unfortunately i end up gagging and throwing up the food i swallowed up. — i’m sorry if this is a stupid question, i feel like a lost child again and don’t know anything."
returning back to school,"I left school for two months and gained 20 lbs in treatment. I just need like 5lbs to gain before they will let me go back to school, and then I'll restore the rest of my weight through an outpatient program. How can I cope with coming back to school looking completely different? I know I look healthier but just the thought of people noticing me back and also noticing me with a completely different body makes me so anxious. I feel like people will really judge me and ask me where I have been which idek how ill respond. even if they don't judge me or ask me, I still dont like the thought of people even noticing me. I really wanna go back to school but I feel like my anxiety will make it a living hell. Any tips please?"
Will my gut and digestion ever heal?,Hi so I’ve damaged my body severely by restricting for a looong time and i want to get better and eat more food but when i try to i just can’t digest any “regular”  amount of food. Is there hope for healing my gut or am I f’ed for life?
Prob need hospital but scared for the impact on my partner,"Ok, so around about October last year I started to relapse after about 2 years of recovery. Its now the end of March and tbh I'm probably the sickest I've ever been in my disorder. My therapist and fiance have convinced me to look into PHP day programs in my area to go to. (I've been to a program before on 3 separate occasions. I have serious issues with the program surrounding their treatment of my gender, pressure to include my abusive mother in my therapy or the program would stop treating me, and generally their very rigid rules around all aspects of my recovery, some of which I feel are harmful to recovery.) Now it's looking like I  may need to go to the hospital based on my physical deterioration.  


This is where I'm starting to get scared. I have trauma surrounding people I love leaving my life by choice. The prospect of going into the hospital where things will seem to get worse before they get better worries me as my partner has dealt with seeing his loved ones hospitalized again and again as a youth. I know the sight of me in the bed with whatever monitors and possible feeding apparatuses will be tough for my partner to see. He has told me that he loves me and of course would not abandon me like that. 1. I don't want to cause him pain and flashbacks 2. He also deals with mental health disorders and I've been his support during the times it's been especially difficult for him. 

I'm worried that my getting admitted  would cause him more suffering. I don't want to do that to him. I know I need to focus on my health and wellbeing if I'm going to continue to be able to help and support him, but I guess I'm scared of getting that help myself. IDK really what I hope to get from any responses here but hey, maybe someone will talk some sense into me."
"I can’t tell if my thoughts comes from me or my ed, and it’s so overwhelming and hard. Some days I feel like the luckiest person with the best partner ever, and love him more than anything. But other days I can’t even look at him without getting icky and wanting to end the relationship.",
Hard day at work and family dinner later...,"Hey y'all, I need some kind words and suggestions. I've had a terrible day at work and gave a family dinner later and I already feel like it'll be difficult to eat. Does anyone have any coping strategies I could use? I feel bloated and incredibly anxious 😢"
Recovery apps,"Hello, lately I have been thinking about going all in and in fact me and my family are commanding actions to get me 100% out of anorexia (i am on quasi recovery) And I've been wondering, do any of you use apps for your recovery? which ones do you recommend?
I only use a water meter (cuz I have problems with ingesting a small amount of liquid And I need to keep a counter to know that I have already taken the minimum) but i wish i have More tools to help me"

Has anyone been triggered by school fitness tests/BMI report cards?,"A lot of schools require students to participate in fitness tests and/or BMI report card programs (sometimes called ""fitnessgrams""). They include the pacer running test, measuring flexibility and weighing students to calculate their BMI.

My name is Amanda Salazar, and I'm a graduate student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in NYC and freelance journalist. I also have a restrictive eating disorder (I don't have a diagnosis so I don't know what to call it), so I definitely relate. I'm working on a story for my health journalism class and for future publication about how school BMI report cards can negatively impact students' mental health and eating habits. A recent study actually found that when teens consider themselves overweight, it increased their risk of developing disordered eating not only as teens but also for years and years into adulthood. BMI report cards that tell students if they're overweight or not can contribute to this issue.

I'm looking to speak to people with EDs who remember these BMI report cards and fitness tests who had a negative experience with them. I would love to hear other people's experiences to include in my piece. Since I myself have an ED, I'm not going to exploit your experiences or anything like that, I just want to share people's experiences to show that these fitness tests can be bad for mental health. If you're willing to speak with me for the story, please let me know! You can respond to this or send me a message. My email is [Amanda.salazar13@journalism.cuny.edu](mailto:Amanda.salazar13@journalism.cuny.edu). Thank you!"
Recovery feels so much harder because I’ve always been considered “bigger”,"I absolutely am not here to minimise anyone’s struggle, but I feel like recovery is harder when you’re not skinny. I am and have always been midsized. And people don’t encourage my recovery. In fact, I haven’t told anyone I struggle with anorexia because they’d just push me to keep going and lose weight. Because I’m a minor and living at home, this also means I can’t get professional help. So I’m in it alone. Naturally I turn to recovery social media accounts. But even that isn’t the same when you’re already a bigger size. “Eat with me” videos just make me feel bad. I see all the comments praising them for eating and I just know I would only get hate. I see people challenging fear foods but whenever I do it all I can think is “they can afford that, you can’t because even when you’ve starved for weeks you’re bigger than they’ll ever be.”. I know this is just the typical “not sick enough” mindset, but it gets worse when you have actually proof to back up those thoughts. I don’t know any recovery accounts that are my size. Idk where I’m going with this but it just fucks me up. I just ate a whole chocolate bar as a fear food challenge and I know if I was sickly skinny people would praise me but I’m not telling anyone because I would only be shamed more by others than I’m already shaming myself."
Bloating,I’ve been insanely bloated for a year straight since starting recovery 😭 should I get this checked out or try to trust the process a little longer? I saw doctors when I was actively sick and they only found mild gastritis so idk if I’d get any different results. I’m also wary of doctors bc I’m scared they won’t be understanding of my ed history and tell me to lose weight.
How to deal with the self-hatred during recovery?,"Hey y’all. I’m just sitting over here with myself struggling with the struggle that is being in recovery. 🤦‍♀️ 
My body has been taking a LONG LONG TIME to fully go through recovery ❤️‍🩹. I’m about to be on 5years of sustained recovery without relapsing.

I miss having a flat stomach the most now I’m constantly bloated. My boobs STILL are growing every other day. And my face is full and puffy.

The thing that bothers me the most is that I’m clearly still having moments of weight redistribution where it will basically ALL go to my abdominal area and then weeks or months later it will go to my tits or legs/ass.
I have to buy plus size clothing for these times only for it all to fit strangely anyway.
Like clothing in plus sizes expects fat in places I just don’t seem to have it but my stomach needs the extra room.
Ugh yeah just makes hate how I look. However, I’m still “filling out” as they say.
But I hate looking at myself ever and seeing how overweight I am. And now I’m medically genuinely overweight but I know that happens a lot in recovery. How do y’all stay on the bandwagon? Is it healthy to try and lose weight ever again?"
I can’t stop brushing my teeth,"After every meal, every snack, or every piece of food that touches my mouth, I can’t stop brushing my teeth. I do it to keep me from snacking/eating, although I’m a good 8 months into recovery. I’m going back into old habits though. Does anyone have a similar experience and know how to overcome this?"
My waitress embarrassed me on my date last night.,"Her:”Wow you know exactly what you want I guess.” 

Me: looking confused 

Her:”well it’s just you ordered half a meal.”

walks off laughing

My boyfriend and I were eating at a restaurant that has bingo night and she sent my brain on a spiral. I just stared at my bingo card while my brain was elsewhere. Out side opinions are really what makes this hard for me personally. More often than not I have to use my coping skills because someone else couldn’t keep their mouth shut."
Hotel breakfast,"I’ve eaten according to a meal plan provided by my ED team for no more than two days now so am I still very much figuring things out

Any tips on how to deal with the buffet style breakfast at a hotel? I’m already freaking out as I’ve eaten very scary things today during my trip and my Ed brain is telling me I’ve massively overeaten

I’m not abroad so there will be known/safe foods but I’m still terrified cause I want to enjoy it so badly😭"
Today is the first day of the rest of my life,"Today I have gone all in. 

I have been in quasi recovery for almost a year now with a minor relapse over the past 3 or so weeks and it has become too much. I’ve lost my family’s trust, I’ve lost friendships. I’m so fucking tired. 

I woke up this morning and decided enough was enough. I decided to flip my day on it’s head. Not do my ‘allowed’ exercise. Have breakfast as soon as I got up instead of delaying for as long as possible. 

I didn’t put my Apple Watch on today. I have broken a 540 day streak of ‘closing my rings’. 

For breakfast I made cinnamon pancakes from scratch with yoghurt, blueberries, strawberries, banana, maple syrup, and Reese’s peanut butter chips that mum bought me ages ago but I have been too scared to open. 

Then I was still hungry so I had a slice of a fruit loaf mum had made and I toasted it and put banana on top with maple syrup and more peanut butter chips lol

Then I was craving a milo so I had fat fucking milo (it’s a malt chocolate powder here in Australia that you mix with milk), this is the first time I’ve had milk in like a year. 

By 8:15am I think I had eaten more calories than I have in a full day in YEARS! 

I have also been craving an almond croissant. So by 10am I asked mum if we could go get coffee and croissants. It was so yum. 

I just made lunch and I had an omelette with eggs, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, ham, spring onion, and rocket and had it with a toasted English muffin with pizza sauce! 

I feel so full. I feel sick. Both from food and from anxiety. I feel so anxious right now. I’m spiralling a bit. 

But also I feel proud. This morning when I walked downstairs I told my mum this is what I was going to do today. Nothing else is working, may as well just try it for a day. She burst into tears. 

I owe it to those around me to stick at this. I owe it to myself."
I think I am relapsing,"I have adult onset, trauma-induced AN and have been doing really well - weight improved, period restored, liver function normal for the first time in years. Picked up full time work, my nephew was born, I got a puppy and am in a very loving, new relationship - all helping me with managing behaviours and coping with trauma triggers in giving me something to recover for. Even the ED thoughts and chewing and spitting were reducing and my food enjoyment was improving. 

Noticing my body changing and my weight increasing have brought back a ton of the thoughts, guilt and shame. Chewing and spitting is worse and calorie counting is coming back. I’m determined not to relapse because I know how much AN hurt my family, and how scared they were I would die. I guess I’m just looking for reassurance that this is normal and that I can get through it."
I’m sick of abnormal lab results. Being a vegetarian isn’t good for me anymore. Help!!!,"My iron levels are still low; triglycerides levels are still low. I’m sick of this shit. 2 years of recovery and I want to just be normal and have a normal body that functions normally. My doctor suggested eating meat is the only way to ensure my iron levels will go up.

Note my BMI puts me in a normal person category now- it’s just my body is loaded with inflammation from having positive ANA and allergies. 
I have an overactive immune system meaning I have extreme allergies to dairy, gluten, seafood, and all tree nuts excluding coconuts. Although I was consuming dairy during my recovery and gluten as well, my doctor said my body doesn’t properly absorb any of it. 

It’s not easy to be in recovery from a disease as ominous as anorexia and now know I have to restrict my diet to reduce more health complications

Eating meat will be the only way to ensure I’m getting the protein/ b vitamin , fat and iron requirements I need. Has anyone who’s been a vegetarian long term transition back to an omnivorous diet and if so, how did you do it?"
Co-worker Triggers me,"I have been in recovery for a year and a half. It has been pretty successful and when I’m having a bad day I remind myself how awful I used to feel. Weak, tired, headaches, light headed,obsessive you know the feels. I work with a 53 year old woman who talks about her struggles with anorexia a lot. She is always talking about fad diets and defending them saying they are not fads. She goes into detail about all the things she is currently restricting and how unhappy she is with her body. The way she talks is a lot like how my mother talked growing up. When I felt comfortable I told her that I also struggle with anorexia but I do not wish to talk about it. I try my best to let it all go in one ear and out the other but its starting to weigh on me and I think that she may trigger me to the point that I break. I’ve had to set boundaries with people before about not bringing me into these types of conversations and it really didn’t change anything for more than a day or two. It is starting to feel spiteful like she is purposefully trying to trigger me. I’m not sure what I can say to her to make her without hurting her feelings because she is very sensitive. I am not saying being sensitive is a bad thing at all I can be really sensitive myself. I just don’t want to hurt her feelings and sometimes I let things bottle up to long and I do hurt feelings."
Ate candy without knowing the calories,"My coworker recently shared their tropical Skittles with me. They know that I'm in a weird spot of recovery. As in they know I have days where I actually want to get better, and then there are my depression ~~days~~ weeks. They also know that I have several food allergies. So when I asked for the bag ""to only read the ingredients"", they didn't hand me the bag. Instead they read the ingredients out loud.

After learning the ingredients, I accepted a small handful. Only one flavour wasn't enjoyable.

Best part, if with how easy it was/is to look up that information, I continue to stay ignorant on the calorie amount."
Eating around others,"Ok so this is kinda stupid, but does anyone else feel weird eating more than you used to around other people? It’s like for months now my friends/bf have seen me as this dainty, small person who really doesn’t eat a lot, and that’s the story I went with to hide how much I was restricting. In actuality, I’m an athlete and I need to eat a LOT to maintain my weight, especially now that I’m in recovery. So now I feel kinda weird eating more around other people, who have definitely noticed a change."
Bad Days,"Having trouble recently. I've been in recovery for a few years now, doing great, on medication. But about a week ago I kind of just forgot to eat and it's sort of slowly spiraled since then. I know that it's not about the food or the weight, and I've even identified what's been making me feel this way, but I don't have any way of dealing with it. I'm so fucking terrified to relapse, but it's getting harder and harder to eat. I don't know what to do."
recovering from relapse,"i am craving exercise soo much, not even as a way of punishing myself. i just want to move and walk and run and lift weights and do yoga and do pilates and strength train and feel my body and the food i'm eating allows me to do that. i am not in a good phase in my life at the moment but when i'm exercising i'm reminded of the things i have and the things i'm grateful for"
MANTRA (maudsley model of anorexia nervosa treatment for adults),"I've struggled with an eating disorder for about a decade but even before that as a child I always was a little weird with food and weight. 

I have finally been accepted by an eating disorder service after a couple failed attempts in my teens (literally begged gp and camhs). 

I'm starting on Friday after being on a waiting list since November. They emailed me saying I will be doing MANTRA. It looks like a workbook that I'll work through with a therapist and dietitian. I haven't even been diagnosed yet or anything as I self referred and have only been to an initial assessment so far. 

Does anyone have any experience with this method? Or general UK therapy for adults? Not really sure but I've never heard of it and I can't see too much online about it. 

I'm absolutely shitting it and just want some idea of what it'll be like so I can calm down a bit. I keep having thoughts of calling it all off because I'm so terrified and I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this irl"
SSRIs to aid recovery,"Hi there, 

I’m curious if anyone has ever started an SSRI (specifically escitalopram / lexapro) to assist recovery? 

I think a lot of my anorexia stems from the need for control and the anxiety around not losing that control. 

I’ve taken escitalopram in the past (a number of years ago) for generalised anxiety disorder and it helped a lot. I don’t feel anxious in the same ways as I did when I was diagnosed with GAD those years ago, but there’s certainly an element of anxiety regarding control that has manifested itself in my eating disorder. 

I really want to get better but have been struggling in recovery and I’m thinking maybe I should go back on meds. 

Curious about anyone’s experiences in this realm :)

Thank you"
Potential ulcerative colitis diagnosis after Ed,Has anyone experienced thing or overcome it?
"Is it normal to weigh more now I’m 22, than I did when I was 18","Hi, so I’ve been in recovery for 16 months, with a few small relapses, but none for last 6/7 months. I haven’t been weighing myself but today I did out of curiosity. It really freaked me out, even though the difference between my pre Ed weight and now isn’t that big, but it’s really triggered me to want to lose weight to be back at my pre ex weight from when I was younger. This is so annoying because I’ve been doing really well in recovery since my last relapse, but this has really shook me. I feel really insecure, especially as it is coming close to summer and will be seeing more of my body when wearing summer clothes. I feel like I’m doomed to be miserable because I’ll either relapse and be miserable in my Ed or always feel insecure in my healthy body"
End it,"I just want to end it. I really want to recover, to gain myself back, but yet still I'm counting my calories, increasing too slow, taking step goals everyday, body checking and not doing anything else besides that. I have a bf, it's spring, it's getting so beautiful and warm out here, part of me wants to just let go and go out with him, do something productive. I'm literally ruining our relationship, we never go out bc I have a routine that my ed made, seems like I'm too weak to let it go. My libido is gone. Thank god he understands and supports me while I'm trying to recover, but I'm not telling him what I do everyday - that's the fucked up part. Why we can't go out, why I always come to him late, exhausted. We used to adventure so much together, now it's just me, my house, my step and calorie goal. Crying my eyes out, bc I think he needs someone better, I see that he is losing his spark. And I understand, I got boring."
What word do you associate with recovery?,Just one.
Random vent? Idk? Trying to feel less alone.,"I’ve been in ‘recovery’ since June 2022. The first two-three weeks were probably the closest I’ve gotten to proper recovery because I was threatened IP. Since then it has really been quasi / harm reduction with slow, small steps of progress. 

Everyone around me is getting frustrated by how slow this is. I’m even getting frustrated with myself. 

Here’s the weird part: I KNOW I need to gain weight and I genuinely am comfortable with that. BUT I’m sooo uncomfortable with losing control over it. 
I was happier, more attractive, healthier when I was about 10kgs more. 
I’m happy to gain this back. But I don’t want it to be more than that. And I don’t want it to happen too fast. I want to control the pace of the gain to the gram. 
I don’t want to go ‘too far’ the other way. 
For context: I used to be a lottttt bigger. Got into the gym and exercise for healthy, happy reasons and I lost a bit of weight naturally and felt my best about 10kg+ from where I am now. 
But that weight loss soon stopped being healthy and I developed anorexia, leading to more rapid and dramatic loss. 

Does anyone else get where I’m coming from?"
Recovery stuff,"Today, for the first time in months, I ate three meals, and didn’t stop at any of them until I was full. Sure, they were all healthy foods, and I looked at the calories and kinda halfway counted them, but I didn’t go out of my way to count them exactly. It was all stuff I’d been craving too, and I even allowed myself to replace a few safe foods with similar but higher calorie versions of them because I *wanted* them, and because I know I can’t afford to lose any more weight. You have no idea how fucking weird it feels to say that. I have idealized weight loss for so long, the concept of it as a bad thing is still backwards for me. Anyways, I know an estimate of how much I ate, but have no way of knowing the numbers for sure. It kinda sucks, but part of me doesn’t care. My body just feels too happy idk how else to explain it."
Please help me understand I'm doing the right thing,"
(Crosspost from /r/fuckeatingdisorders)

The oscillation between wanting to achieve my goals and being desperately afraid of gaining weight is incredibly painful. 

I'm trying to do well in """"recovery"""" (I've just decided to up intake for x amount of time but who knows, maybe I'll decide to pull myself out of this relapse for real) but it's been emotionally devastating to try to just maintain my weight, then be smacked with an unholy amount of hunger. Like, getting shaky after breakfast, feeling weak 30 minutes after lunch, when I could function OK before without either of those. The amount I'm eating is literally double what I was eating before.

I try to calm myself down by reminding myself I'm doing a lot more now, but at the end of the day (literally), I'm terrified of gaining weight from this. I won't be weighing myself during this time period because I can't afford to focus on that now, but I'm so worried about weight and fat on my body, and I'm hyper aware of the feeling of being inside my body. 

FFS. I'm just rambling but I don't know where else to turn right now. My heart is really heavy with this. I want to fully enjoy and take advantage of this practicum experience with my whole heart and mind but the ED is stealing it from me... Yet when I try to fight it, I am weighed down by guilt, fear, and disgust with myself. Thanks to anyone who got this far. I would be so grateful for words of wisdom or advice to help center me."
Extreme weight gain in 2 weeks?? (Numbers),I gained 23 pounds in 2 weeks. I know it isnt actual fat but should i be concerned about something? Im stressing tf out
feel so guilty and just need some support rn,"i have been doing a rly good job eating enough lately. i eat when im hungry and even if i eat when im bored i don’t beat myself up about it. but today i are so much, and it felt almost uncontrollable and not normal, now im scared im going to develop binge eating, because no matter how full i felt i just wanted to keep eating. i am stuffed rn, but the worst part is, i want to keep eating more and i feel like eating more. im actually almost disturbed by this feeling because I don’t feel satisfied with anything ive eaten. can someone help:("
suggestions for cheaper meal supplements?,"i recently started recovering and sometimes its just really hard to eat but i know i still have to so my family decided that we should try to keep ensures or something in the house for when i have those moments 

all the ones ive seen are expensive for my family so does anyone know where i can get them cheap in bulk or a less expensive but still decent quality brand?"
"3 months free, 7 months recovery","Hey.

I just wanted to pop in and share my success with recovery. I've been completely ed-free for 3 months and in recovery for 7-8 months.

 I don't know my weight, but i know this is the weight my body is supposed to be in because i'm SO much stronger, healthier, happier and more energetic. I'm even healthier than i started out because after putting my body through so much, i've started treating it with utmost care. 

I've started going to gym 4x a week, kickboxing, really focusing on exams and started dating for first time in my life. It's crazy to see how much my life has improved and equally crazy to read some of the things i wrote when i was in the middle of ed. 


There is hope y'all! You are going to look back and see how much ed life sucked! You're not going to have ed forever, unless you want to."
Help me find out what is going on with this bloating that won't go away,"Hi everyone

I am trying to help my girlfriend find out what is going on with her body / bloating issue and thought about crowdsourcing information from people who might have experienced the same / know something about it. (***I could post pictures here anonymized to show what I am talking about but I want to know if it is allowed first***).

A little context:

My girlfriend has been struggling with Anorexia for 20 years or so (now 38) and although she's recovered her weight for quite some years and looks healthy, there are still a lot of food fears and psychological issues that characterize this disorder. She, for example, struggles to eat on her own or make her own food and easily would skip a meal if she doesn't have someone helping her. She also has other conditions (Generalized Anxiety, ADHD, Fibromyalgia).

Last year in March she took her first full-time job as a psychologist (she's amazing at that and has all the insights you'd wish from someone, though putting them into practice is another story - that's also where her undiagnosed ADHD has definitely not helped her recover) and as she got busy in her work, it became easy to ""forget"" to eat her lunch because of no break between clients or whatever ""excuse"".   


All of a sudden, over the course of a month of skipping lunch too regularly, her stomach suddenly blew up. Sometimes is less sometimes more but you could easily think she's pregnant. All other meals have been eaten and supervised by me.

She said in the past she has tried this before and seems to happen when she ""relapsed"" and isn't consistent with her eating / skipping some meals, but doesn't recall it taking this long / being this bad.  

She never understood what the problem is/was, nor had she ever investigated it. 

We did recently blood work (general), MRCP scan, colonoscopy, gastroscopy, and ultrasound and everything looked fine, though there's obviously a physiological process at play and we can't seem to figure out what it is, so I appeal to your experience and maybe someone can point us to the right place? 

What can this be? what can the cause be? What tests can she do that we haven't done? Does it disappear by itself and go back to normal? What are dos and donts? Something she should eat more of? less of? 

No stomach cramps or aches, only a bit of discomfort when it is really expanded. The major issue with this besides obviously not understanding what is going on (doctors haven't been helpful really, I am very disappointed by the medical scene in the country we live in) is the fact that it draws more and more attention to her body which she had actually started to be able to see that she looks great and started appreciate it and ""loving"" her body if i could take it this far.

This also prevents her from doing the activities she loves (dancing) because she is uncomfortable with the look and feel of the stomach as well as the questions those can bring about by people (she's very sensitive) 

Edit: now it’s been over a year and the problem is as bad as when it started though we fixed the skipping meals part about two month into the issue manifested and she’s been off work on stress leave since November 2022 and since may 2022 her food has been regular with no skipping.

She’s also have been in her late years / recovery started purging and done that lightly but regularly. Now she’s over 6 months without having done that. 

Any help would be massively appreciated!"
DAE feel like therapy/nutritionalist can hinder some parts of recovery?,"I don’t believe I’ve posted in this sub before, but ****trigger warning.*****

I am about 3 years into recovery. Been through a couple nutritionalists and one CEDS. I liked my CEDS a lot but she was expensive. 

A lot of the time after seeing my nutritionalist all I can think about is how bad I’ve been doing lately. Granted I’ve had a lot of stressers pop up more than usual. 

For instance, I’ll go to make something to eat, and all I think about is how I’m not doing enough, eating enough, eating well enough, etc. i think about people’s responses to I ate in a day when they asked. Then I’ll just avoid eating because well ‘whenever I eat it isn’t adequate anyways, I don’t have [blank] food group like I’m supposed to in this meal’

I don’t even know what to call this behavior. I feel like I’m mentally being a perfectionist about eating adequately to the point I’m restricting? I feel like I’ve gotten to the point in my recovery that others don’t view me eating in general as something to be proud of on it’s own. 

Like right now I need to eat dinner, but all my meat is frozen so all I can think about is how I need to have meat in my dinner or else it isn’t good enough. 

idk, just have been feeling very discouraged lately. maybe im making a mountain out of a mole hill.

Edit: I’ve been hesitant to post in this sub for a while, but the responses have made me feel less alone!!!"
Does anyone else just not want to eat bc they’re tired of it?,"I want to honor my extreme hunger to the fullest but I just get so tired of having to eat all the time. It’s gotten to the point where sometimes I get genuinely upset that I’m hungry and start crying bc it literally never ends. I’ve had extreme hunger for a year straight and it completely controls me. Every day is just wake up, eat, maybe nap, eat more, go to the store bc I’m out of food already, eat again, sleep. It’s so exhausting and I feel completely controlled by it. I think I’m just losing motivation bc I’m so burnt out by it. Has anyone else experienced feeling like this?"
How to work through this mentally & how to explain to partner,"Hello. I knew I struggled with food all my life pretty much, but this last year stress and trauma have come up and it’s effected my eating in damaging ways. I had a dr actually tell me I was starving myself yesterday and it was the first time a professional acknowledged I had an ED. It’s making me face things and take it more seriously. I really am making an effort to heal and eat enough. It just feels so daunting. 

Does anyone have tips for processing and working through this? 

Part of it is hard because no one would look at me and guess I’m starving myself. 

And if anyone has tips on explaining to a partner why people do this that makes it so hard to “just eat more”, that would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you 

TLDR: 1. Tips for mentally processing and working through this ED. 2. How ti explain to a partner why it’s not simply a case of “eating more”"
"Anyone else ""mark"" their recovery with a certain food item?","The day I started taking recovery seriously I went to an ice-cream place after a giant dinner (i usually would have fasted all day if i wanted desert after a ""normal"" dinner) and got this big ass 8 inches across cookie ice cream sandwich (ice cream in between two cookies) with peanut butter ice cream and wolfed that shit down. I put the sticker that came on the wrapper on my wall for memories lmao. I wish i had a picture of the sandwich."
how to expand a small stomach size to be able to eat more?,"i don’t have anorexia *nervosa*, but i am anorexic, due to chronic issues of very poor appetite from other mental illnesses. at this point, i wonder if my stomach is also just very small, since when i do actually eat, after barely eating all day, i eat very little and feel full, or get too nauseous to continue.  this causes me to feel hungry often. when i feel hungry, i often end up skipping the ordinary hunger feelings and go straight to intense weakness and pain, which is frustrating. but i’m here to ask if you have any methods for increasing stomach size, if that’s my issue. i know the obvious answer is just “eat a little more each time,” but i have terrible appetite and that’s close to impossible for me. can i drink a lot of a liquid or something?"
